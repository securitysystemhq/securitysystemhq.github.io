Home monitoring sensors have a number of applications in your overall home security.</p>

The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

Properly located video surveillance cameras can extend the range of the security staff and provide valuable incident information.

<h3>5 Reasons To Install a Video Security Camera System At Your Home in Lexington</h3>
<p>A hard wired alarm system would usually be installed by a professional to hide the cables, thus increasing the installation cost.

Burglar alarms which you can install yourself break down into four groups: wired-in systems, wire-less systems, door alarms and movement detectors.</p>
<p>Depending upon whether IP camera or analog video camera is used, the captured video can be transmitted over cables or through the air. The key advantage of smoke detectors is their ability to identify a fire while it is still in its incipient. You'll find security providers that offer smart home devices, and those who mainly offer integration, meaning that the security system will work well with devices from different manufacturers.</p>
<p>Among the sales arguments advanced for the burglar alarm, one of the strongest was that maintenance costs for the system were extremely low. Retail establishments use video surveillance to monitor what customers do. For example, if a client claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, video surveillance records are used to determine whether she was in the store on the day in question, and if she did purchase the item.</p>
