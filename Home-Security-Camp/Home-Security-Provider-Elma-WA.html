Mounted in places such as driveways, parking lots, parking garages, and car alarm stores, video surveillance cameras are valuable in protecting one's investment. Smoke and fire detectors that aren't wired directly into your alarm system cannot summon emergency personnel.</p>

Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>
<p>The computerized logic of the control panel analyzes multiple detectors at the same time to decide on the most appropriate course of action. Smart fire alarm systems can perform integrated automatic actions, for example, discharge fire-suppression systems in closed designated areas; and vary the notifications to support people on their way out, while protecting expensive electronic equipment inside. The test only used four smoke detectors and has not yet met the problem of excessive data volume.</p>
