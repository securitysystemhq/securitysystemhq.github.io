<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring generally carries a monthly cost on top of your equipment cost.
