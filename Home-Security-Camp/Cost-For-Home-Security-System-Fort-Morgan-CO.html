<p>Video: Big security operation centers where a lot of cameras must be examined or scrutinized, video wall viewing is generally preferred.

Monitored home security systems cost between $20 and $60 per month. Note: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and leave out the old analog cameras, given that everyone favors IP cameras today for their affordable prices, features and easy setup.</p>
