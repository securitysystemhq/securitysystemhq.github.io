<p>Setting up home security systems will be a good idea to keep your home secured. 6. In a protective alarm system, means for creating two light beams extending across an area to be protected, means for converting said beams into electrical energy, means for chopping said beams in such a manner that the output of said converting means is constant and will vary in voltage when one of said beams is modified by an intruder in said area and indicating means responsive to said varying electrical energy.</p>
