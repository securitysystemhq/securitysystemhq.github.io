<p>Surveillance cameras on the corner of a building. 5. In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two protective light beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses and shaped to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photoelectric means and means responsive to the varying voltage for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Most DIY systems are easy to install and are sold as kits that you can configure to suit your specific needs.
