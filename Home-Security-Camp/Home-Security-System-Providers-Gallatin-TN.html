Firstly, it is a lot cheaper than purchasing a professionally made home security video camera; you are looking at around $300+ for a good store purchased system, whereas you can make your own for less than $100.</p>

<p>Modern technology has made it possible to access the videos from these CCTV security systems live on phones. So if you choose to do the installation yourself and you are not technically inclined, you might specifically look for a security system that is wireless and known for being easy to install.
