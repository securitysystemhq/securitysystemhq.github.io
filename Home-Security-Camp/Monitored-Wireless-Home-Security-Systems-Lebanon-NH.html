That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>

<p>You can also find smart security cameras and lights to augment your home's security. Analog security systems - the recorded images or footage is sent to the DVR recorder (Digital Video Recorder) using a coaxial cable.

CCTV camera, or IP Camera can of course record audio, together with video image. In order to meet your security objectives, cameras (or signs saying cameras are present) must be visible and the cameras must be able to record, store and transmit footage (or be connected to recorder or system that can do so).</p>
<p>The addition of VIP significantly improves the usefulness of CCTV , particularly where there are a large number of cameras installed, which an operator cannot view at the same time.

This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems. But the police say it must be as part of a suite of prevention measures because a burglar alarm on its own will not prevent entry to your home”.</p>
