It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR. Video walls offer a very big screen so that many people can watch the captured videos from a number of cameras at the same time. This will give you the choice of watching the videos from these cameras live or at another time.</p>
