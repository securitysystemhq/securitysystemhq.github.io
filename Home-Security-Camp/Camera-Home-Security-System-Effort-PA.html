<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. There may be no way to avoid the occasional angry or unstable customer, disgruntled employee, parent, violent intruder or disturbed individual, but the installation of a panic system is a great way to mitigate the danger and prepare for it. Wired and wireless solutions from IntraLogic Solutions offer efficient and affordable options, and in many cases leverage existing technology as ready initiating devices.</p>

The following regulatory documents apply to the fire alarm system as opposed to individual smoke alarms of the residential type, even when they are AC powered and used for group operation.
