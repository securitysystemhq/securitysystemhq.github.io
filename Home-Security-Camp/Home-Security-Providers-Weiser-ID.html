<p>Nowadays, all buildings are required to have some sort of fire prevention system in place to ensure the safety of the building's occupants in the event of a fire. Over the past few years there has been an upward trend in terms of migration to HD cctv camera surveillance.

<p>Like any product that connects to the internet and uses wireless technology, smart home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, particularly systems that lack encryption. This helps eliminate false alarms and unnecessary responses. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.
