<p>An Internet protocol camera, or IP camera, is a type of digital video camera commonly employed for surveillance, and which, unlike analog closed circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras, can send and receive data via a computer network and the Internet. Monitor in real-time - There is no having to go back and watch a recording of footage. You should never put your lights on the same timer or schedule your timers to come on at the exact same moment because burglars know to look for this.</p>

This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems.
