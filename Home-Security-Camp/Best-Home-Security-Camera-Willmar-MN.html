Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, casinos, airports, military installations, and convenience stores.</p>
<p>Video: Big security operation centers where a lot of cameras must be examined or scrutinized, video wall viewing is generally preferred. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. Monitored home security systems cost between $20 and $60 per month. Note: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and leave out the old analog cameras, given that everyone favors IP cameras today for their affordable prices, features and easy setup.</p>
