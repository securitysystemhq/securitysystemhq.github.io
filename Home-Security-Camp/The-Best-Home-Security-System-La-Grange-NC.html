<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>For example, if you have mobility issues, you will probably want as many home automation features as you can get your hands on. These will allow you to remotely access, monitor, and control your entire home security system and much of your home's equipment such as door locks, window blinds, small appliances, thermostat, garage door, and more. Having such features will enable you more flexibility with remote or voice controls and without having to physically handle these systems manually.</p>

Along with security cameras and devices to view and record camera images, Other pieces of surveillance equipment may be necessary to complete a video security system.</p>

<p>Homeowners can choose between a landline, broadband or cellular connected system, and the system is controlled through a base station rather than through a keypad on a control panel like most home security systems.
