<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>

However, this type of security camera is still easy to hook up with only one power cable to deal with compared with the traditional analog cameras.

<p>All the components of the system are interconnected using many cameras for critical sites, by means of IP mega pixel cameras. There are two types of security cameras systems, Analog and IP (sometimes refered to as network cameras). Analog cameras: These are usually lower resolution than the more modern IP technology, and require cable connections to a DVR to record and store footage, plus wired connections for power.</p>
<p>Fire alarms shorten your recovery time: Less building damage means shorter downtime until you can reopen for business. Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. In some cases, people will mount signs in their front yards alerting potential intruders that surveillance cameras are in operation. These sensors are positioned strategically around a premises and can detect motion, and trigger the alarm countdown.</p>

Kisi is designed to work with the two most used burglar alarm system styles: an integrated alarm system, and a pin code alarm system.

<h3>Factors to Consider When Buying a Home Security Camera in Macon</h3>
<p>To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cables. It's equipped with two-way audio, 120-degree field of view, night vision and motion detection.

C-mount cameras can cover distances beyond 40 ft thanks to the possibility to use special lenses with these cameras, whereas standard CCTV lenses can only cover distances of 35-40 ft. It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing.</p>
<p>A fire alarm panel is generally pricier than its more traditional counterpart, which is the smoke alarm. Home security companies are giving customers plenty of choices for equipment and services. They include some home alarms, maybe some security cameras, and definitely some non lethal self defense weapons to protect you and your family from a home invader.

Most alarm systems now have a built in power back up system. It is surprising to realize how many people think the fire alarm systems are installed exclusively in corporate buildings and businesses.</p>
