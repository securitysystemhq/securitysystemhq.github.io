The camera communicates with the monitors and the video recorders across the premises through cable or wireless communication links.</p>
<p>The CONNECT (Clinical Evaluation of Remote Notification to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision) trial: the value of wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Bullet cameras are long and cylindrical in shape and are ideal for outdoor use. The outdoor security cameras come in many models. Most of the in-home monitoring systems, proposed in the literature, focus on monitoring a set of specific vital signs.
