In this case, you will probably want a security system that has a quality control panel with a panic button, loud siren, two-way talk feature, high-quality surveillance cameras with real-time recordings and cloud storage, a doorbell camera, and some home automation features that will enable you to monitor and control your system remotely.</p>

Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
<p>These are some of the most important features to keep in mind when comparing home security cameras. You might want to consider a traditional burglar alarm system; this will give you sensors on your doors and windows, and alert you to any intruders. Look for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision. However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>

If you want everything in one complete wireless package with DIY installation, you can get a range of starter kits with everything thrown in.
