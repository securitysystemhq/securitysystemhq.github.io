Along with high resolution images, Matrix IP cameras decrease storage costs by offering latest H.265 Compression technology.

<p>D-Link IP based surveillance technology allows users to integrate audio and motion detectors into cameras, without the need for additional hardware and cabling. Security Info Watch has created a handy primer on compression technology if you're looking to delve into the details of video compression.
