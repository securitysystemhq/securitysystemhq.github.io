<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety. In fact, I can't recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire. In the event of an intrusion or life safety event, the alarm siren on the ADT Security Hub will be activated and an alert will be sent to your smartphone but ADT will not be notified.</p>
<p>You will also need to choose which installation option you prefer for your alarm system: professional or DIY. For example, if a customer claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, or that an employee was rude or provided misinformation, video surveillance records can be used to determine whether they were in the store on the day in question, and what, in fact, took place. SiteService remotely connects to any AK SC 255, AK SC 355, or AK SM 800 series Danfoss control system and gives you a full visualization of live plant status, alarm management, system performance history, and component settings.</p>
