An individual (not a business or organization), may record a conversation as long as one of the participants has consented to the recording.</p>
<p>Detection devices run the gamut, from smoke detectors and heat detectors to multi-capability detectors, which contain a number of functions in one detector. Most companies also offer yard signs and window decals to warn potential burglars that a house is protected by an alarm service.

Today; however, reliable home security companies have come to realize that an audible alarm is sometimes simply not enough to completely eliminate the threat of a home invasion. Associating DVR systems along with CCTV security cameras is a brilliant idea but cabling complexities and the problem of managing of the cables will always be there.</p>
<p>The system can be armed or disarmed using wireless remote control that can also be used as panic switch to alert neighbors in case of medical emergency or physical attacks or robberies.
