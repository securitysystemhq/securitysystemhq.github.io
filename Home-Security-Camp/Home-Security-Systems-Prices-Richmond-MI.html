<p>In 2001, more than 75 percent of the dispatched alarm calls for fire response were deemed false, unintentional, or a system malfunction. When one of our technicians designs your video surveillance system, they will add even more value to your CCTV system by strategically setting up your cameras and using different lens angles to achieve a better view of your building or office's points of interest. False alarms are, however, a trouble within several states which is why false alarms are being banned by the administration.</p>
<p>This is totally untrue that CCTV cameras can be crime solver as CCTV cameras can only reduce the crime by capturing the on going scene. The essence of a fire alarm system, as opposed to individual smoke detectors, even if they are wired to indicate in concert, is that it is supervised from a central location. In the past you'd need deep pockets to have a Yale system professionally installed (and then monitored for an extra cost) but the Smart Living range is DIY, wireless and app-controlled.</p>
