Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>Strategically placed cameras could mean would-be burglars bypass your business for an easier target. This is as simple as it sounds, wired burglar alarm systems mean that all the connecting component parts need to be wired together to complete the electrical circuit. The security systems run from $500,000 per district for an analog system consisting of CCTV (closed circuit television) monitors to million-dollar IP-based systems with digital surveillance cameras connected to a web network.</p>
<p>Video surveillance is cost effective and scalable. If you have a large home or property that needs comprehensive coverage, wired systems are a better option because they can support more cameras.

<p>If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address.
