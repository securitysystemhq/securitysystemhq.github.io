Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on gives you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away. The detection principle of an Addressable System is the same as a Conventional System except that each detector is given a set Address (usually by means of a dip-switch) and the Control Panel can then determine exactly which detector or call point has initiated the alarm.</p>
<p>In this instance, we're talking about home security systems, which are networks of integrated electronic devices working together with a central control panel to protect against burglars and other potential home intruders. Mounted in places such as driveways, parking lots, parking garages, and car alarm stores, video surveillance cameras are valuable in protecting one's investment.
