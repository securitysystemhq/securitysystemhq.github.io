<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>Bullet Cameras: Bullet security cameras are a type video surveillance camera that are typically small and shaped like a rifle bullet shell or lipstick case.

<p>For a more elaborate setup, choose a multiple camera setup; you may want the cameras to be able to give you facial details on people who are more than 25 feet away, in which case you need a camera with a larger lens, usually about an 8 mm. You then send a wireless signal to your DVR recording equipment. Keeping these figures in mind, millions across the United States now depend on burglar alarms as an effective way to protect.</p>

When your video cameras are installed, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the central station.</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>

Provides information about applications of smoke detectors used in conjunction with fire alarm systems.
