<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>

According to the most recent data, Angie's List member reported paying an average of $740 for security alarm installation, and many jobs fell in the $600 to $850 range.</p>
<p>The sensors are a component of a lighting system so that when motion is detected the lights come on. This can be used for safety purposes, that is, a sensor may detect when a car (even your own car) pulls into the driveway and exterior lights are activated.
