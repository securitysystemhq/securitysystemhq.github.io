<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Wireless alarms look nicer but are more expensive. Footage is also often recorded at a lower resolution than wired cameras, making it more difficult to identify people in recordings. It also offered a pledge of commitment to security and released a fleet of updated equipment to settle customer worries and instill greater confidence in their services. A security camera DVR can operate remotely, it is able to detect movement and it has an internal memory that saves captured footage taken over a long period of time.</p>
