<p>Fire alarms are important security devices which help to seek protection against fire accidents. If you have an Xfinity X1 cable TV box, you can control the system from there and watch live video from the camera. We specialize in providing an extensive range of CCTV cameras, and performing research and development in Camera DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for other renowned manufacturers.

If you are worried that your home can be robbed, it is a good idea to go for a combination intruder and fire monitoring service. This means that all programming and "decisions" that an alarm panel has to make when it detects an intruder is all contained within the electronic circuit board that is installed in the home or business.</p>

It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.
