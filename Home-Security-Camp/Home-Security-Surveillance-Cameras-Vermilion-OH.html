<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Once you have decided the type of security and the models that you want installed at your premises, Optex Pinnacle India has tie-ups with several third party service providers PAN India to get the best systems installed at your premises with minimal installation cost and time needed.

<p>This extra length of cable is needed if in the future monitoring or location will have to be moved slightly. This is the role of fire detection and alarm systems. Electronic security systems that connect to phone lines are offered by telephone monitoring services that respond to calls. If people know that there are cameras around them, they will most likely not do anything stupid. Connect video cables to the DVR video in ports.</p>

<p>Sometimes also known as CCTV or Closed Circuit Television, video surveillance systems can allow you to track and monitor anything going on inside your home whether you're there or not.

<p>Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensors in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.

A basic intruder alarm system consists of a control panel, with rechargeable battery power backup and internal or external keypads, several interior and perimeter intrusion detectors, and one external sounder, at least.</p>
<p>IP networks allow for more intelligence for surveillance than legacy analog networks. With the start of 2010, many research labs, such as Kiwi Security Labs, started to broadcast the Advanced Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems” (AIVSS).
