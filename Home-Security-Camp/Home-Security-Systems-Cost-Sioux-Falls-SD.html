Cameras include Greet for the front door, Pivot for indoor monitoring, Torch Pro for lighting up and monitoring outdoors. ADT Motion Sensor Protection embeds advanced safety methods into your home security system. Wireless video surveillance has become an important and integral part of our security system. A supervisory control panel or monitor station would normally be used to keep tabs on all individual panels.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
