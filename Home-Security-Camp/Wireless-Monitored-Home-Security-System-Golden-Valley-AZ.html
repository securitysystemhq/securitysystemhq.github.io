<p>Remotely viewing your home security cameras provides you with the ability to always know what is happening at your home, so that you can have peace of mind that everything is ok.

<p>This address is correspondingly programmed into the control panel's memory with information such as the type of device, its location, and specific response details such as which alarm devices are to be activated. Keyholder monitoring is done through a company (the 'receiving centre'), which will either respond itself when the alarm is triggered, or contact your nominated keyholders. Reviewers also praised the ease of use of the key fobs and the ability to disable individual sensors, so you can do things like step out of the back door without setting off the alarm, while still being alerted if someone tries to break down the front door.</p>

Some fully-monitored home security systems also notify your security provider's monitoring center of motion-triggered activity. Therefore, in a business environment I want my cameras highly visible, and if possible I want a big color monitor where all my patrons can see that I have the entire facility under surveillance, including them, and that the pictures are sharp, in color, and with a close enough view to make identification undeniable.</p>
