<p>In addition, the marriage of mass-notification systems (MNS) and fire-alarm control systems is a growing trend that will hopefully continue and be applied in larger varieties of facilities and multibuilding properties, including schools, high-rise buildings, mass-transit hubs, and even public gathering places such as theaters, restaurants, and places of worship.

Surveillance camera come in all shapes and sizes and trying to figure out which surveillance system that will fit your needs can be very frustrating, but most cameras and systems today requires very little experience to install and operate.

<p>This is totally untrue that CCTV cameras can be crime solver as CCTV cameras can only reduce the crime by capturing the on going scene.
