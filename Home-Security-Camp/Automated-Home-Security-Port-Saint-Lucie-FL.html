<p>Whether you have a photoelectric alarm or an ionization detector, regular cleaning will keep your smoke alarm in working order. For data security, the smartphone keeps history of the records in SD card memory. All of the top DVR systems have USB ports for external storage devices and LAN-based video servers are common.
