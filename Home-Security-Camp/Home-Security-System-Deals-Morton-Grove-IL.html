<p>Be that as it may, cameras are only one a player in the general surveillance system, and regardless of whether an ever-increasing number of cameras and video encoders are incorporated, progressed and complex picture examination is still performed on the backend, regularly using cloud-based preparing administrations. These cameras can pick up coloured images in very low-light conditions.
