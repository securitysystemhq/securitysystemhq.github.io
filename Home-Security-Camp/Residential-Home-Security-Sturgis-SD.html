The STROBE signal is the output from the alarm control panel that will enable the flash lamps from the external sounder.</p>

<p>In case of analog cameras, an encoder must be installed to transmit analog video over IP. The input from an analog camera is encoded and output a digital stream for transmission over an IP network. The alarm itself is wired in low-voltage cable, but the control panel usually needs a connection to mains electricity via a fused connection unit.

CCTV camera, or IP Camera can of course record audio, together with video image. In order to meet your security objectives, cameras (or signs saying cameras are present) must be visible and the cameras must be able to record, store and transmit footage (or be connected to recorder or system that can do so).</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services.
