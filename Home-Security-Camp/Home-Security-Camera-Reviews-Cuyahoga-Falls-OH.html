When your alarm goes off, two indicators within the house, such as a door contact and a motion sensor, must both have been triggered to warrant police call-out.</p>

Axis AX is a complete system of high performance fire panels, audio systems, command centres and high performance devices.

These are most commonly seen in offices and other businesses, but can work effectively as a home security surveillance system as well.

In response to the changing public communications network, new alarm systems often can use broadband signaling as a method of alarm transmission, and manufacturers are including IP reporting capability directly in their alarm panel products. A wide range of products are available in Security & Surveillance Cameras section to offer the best to you.</p>
