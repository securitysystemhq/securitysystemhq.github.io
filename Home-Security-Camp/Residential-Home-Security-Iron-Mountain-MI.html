<p>Practically all buildings and a lot of homes these days have fire alarm systems. You need to purchase a base station in addition to the camera, which makes the up-front cost more hefty than other cameras.

<p>It is during this stage that early detection (either human or automatic), followed by a timely response by qualified fire emergency professionals, can control the fire before significant losses occur. Additionally, the cost of motion detector sensors, as well as special sensors that pick up on fire risks, high carbon monoxide levels, and even air conditioning problems, are very expensive.

Non-monitored Security Systems: There are plenty of DIY security systems available today that don't include professionally monitored services.</p>
<p>Some door alarms have an additional 'visitor' setting which gives a chime or bleep when the door is opened.

<p>I bought this security system after a friend's house was burglarized. Most of the best indoor cameras connect using WiFi while some while use Z-Wave or Zigbee.
