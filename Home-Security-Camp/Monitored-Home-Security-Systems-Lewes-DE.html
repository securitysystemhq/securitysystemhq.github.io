<p>These are some of the most important features to keep in mind when comparing home security cameras. You might want to consider a traditional burglar alarm system; this will give you sensors on your doors and windows, and alert you to any intruders. Look for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision.

CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
