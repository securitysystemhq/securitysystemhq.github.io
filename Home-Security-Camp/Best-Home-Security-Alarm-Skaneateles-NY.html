Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>

A non-monitored burglar alarm system operates on a â€˜bells only' basis - in other words, when triggered, its only function is sounding an alarm to alert neighbours and hopefully scare off the intruder.</p>
<p>Whenever there is an unauthorized entry into the house, the system identifies it and alerts by the production of a loud alarm. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. The detector identifies any smoke or heat in the building or if someone uses the manual breakpoint. It is sometimes the case where an alarm panel or wiring is attacked by an intruder and oftentimes the equipment is damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>You can buy additional components individually to extend your protection, or purchase one of the larger Alarm Security Kit bundles. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%).
