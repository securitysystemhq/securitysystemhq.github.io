<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>No, not all providers offer security cameras in their equipment packages. The commonest excuse for the deployment of CCTV cameras is in the prevention and detection of crime. Fire sprinklers utilize water by direct application onto flames and heat, which causes cooling of the combustion process and prevents ignition of adjacent combustibles. In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that's the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>
