The cameras were all configured accordingly and put through their paces one by one to test all functionally of the camera as well as image quality.</p>
<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>

Nest is pricier than most other DIY home security systems, but it's a good choice if you want to monitor your system yourself. Truth is, many home security cameras and systems in the market these days are DIY types, which makes it pretty easy to install by yourself, without additional installation cost.</p>
