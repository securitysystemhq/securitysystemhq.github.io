<p>Installing a CCTV camera can sometimes be difficult and sometimes be easy. A security alarm system does not really intend to help property owners or residents to catch thieves. Adding a security sign in the front window or on a door is also a good way to deter a burglar. Wi-Fi cameras are yet another segment of cameras which is proving its usability in home security. Sound the siren on your Ring Alarm from anywhere inside your home and dispatch emergency services with professional monitoring.</p>

Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad.
