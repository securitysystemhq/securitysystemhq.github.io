<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it. The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale are DIY-installed systems costing as little as £200. The monitoring company has guards watching the screens 24 hours a day just waiting to receive an alarm distress call. There's also a smartphone app and smart home compatibility built-in as well as optional monitoring from ADT and cellular backup.

Wired cameras are hard wired to the security system, meaning you need to physically string power and data cables from a central hub or recording device to each individual camera.</p>
