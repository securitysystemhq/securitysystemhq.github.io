<p>Depending upon whether IP camera or analog video camera is used, the captured video can be transmitted over cables or through the air. The key advantage of smoke detectors is their ability to identify a fire while it is still in its incipient. You'll find security providers that offer smart home devices, and those who mainly offer integration, meaning that the security system will work well with devices from different manufacturers.</p>
