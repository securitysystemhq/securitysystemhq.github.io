<p>Large buildings require a central control panel to show staff and the fire brigade the location of a fire within the building if a fire is detected. Sprinkler systems look bad and will harm the building's appearance. Not all surveillance cameras are static. This box camera includes a 6-60 mm variable focal auto-iris lens which gives security installers a lot of flexibility to adjust the camera angle of view and zoom level. Also to provide high resolution and high quality videos, we have storage like DVRs, NVRs and many other solutions. When hiring an alarm or home security company, check to see if your state requires them to be licensed.</p>

<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
