<p>One of the most important decisions you will have to make for your office is what type of fire alarm system you choose to have installed. I dont see how these CCTV cameras will stop terrorism. Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
