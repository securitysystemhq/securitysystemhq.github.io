<p>But when the door or window is opened by an intruder, the circuit will be open, thus the alarm will be triggered. A video surveillance camera can be used for other types of tests on cars. Hikvision products also provide powerful business intelligence for end users, which can enable more efficient operations and greater commercial success. Two-stage fire alarm systems warn only certain people who are authorized to take appropriate action before the second stage.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system.
