<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Alder offers professional monitoring via a cellular network connection. CCTV relies on strategic placement of cameras and private observation of the camera's input on monitors. The Vivint Smart Home system is the best home security system as it's the most sophisticated and customizable systems on offer. Similar to the existing monitoring systems, the developed system has two interfaces, one for patients and other for the doctor.</p>
<p>Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189).

<p>This is because all of the alarms in each zone have to be wired up, which will take time and more man hours to set up. As stated earlier, there are basically three types of home security alarms: do-it-yourself (DIY) alarms, mid-level alarms and high-end ones. Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
<p>The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS). The camera is equipped with a 130-degree field of view lens, 1080p HDR and a 4K sensor and digital zoom-in up to 12x for crisp, clear camera footage. For the homeowner who likes to attempt DIY then a wireless burglar alarm is an ideal solution. Even public places like parks, shopping malls and restaurants need surveillance cameras.</p>

The Zmodo wireless security camera system is IP65-certified weatherproof and 720p HD night vision within 65 feet. In this chapter an introduction to most of the current video technology and equipment has been described.</p>
<p>Things to consider when it comes to choosing a wireless camera include your home Wi-Fi network speed, the number of devices already using your home Wi-Fi, and whether or not you'd prefer the freedom of a cord-free camera. These are the best home security cameras in every major sub-category, from smart doorbells to the models that work well with Alexa , Google Assistant and Siri voice commands - and beyond.</p>
<p>You can buy additional components individually to extend your protection, or purchase one of the larger Alarm Security Kit bundles. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%). The recording of the video feeds from CCTV cameras will be stored for 30 days for playback, post event analysis and for investigation purposes.</p>
<p>When your alarm is activated the security guards alarm monitoring screen will flash to advise that your home security has been breached. This is anticipated to be major reason for the expansion of the CCTV cameras market during the forecast period. A combination of smoke and heat detectors, sirens and bells, and strobe lights detect fires and alert building occupants, giving them ample time to evacuate in an orderly fashion.</p>

<p>As well as sounding an alarm, such sensors can easily be a part of a burglar alarm with text or phone alerts. Availability of low cost cameras and ease of installation are important factors for growth of DIY cameras. This means that no wiring is needed (except between detection devices and their transmitters) and that the control panel can be situated anywhere in the house and moved around if you want. PTZ cameras are controlled via s security terminal, smartphone app or programmed to operate automated.</p>
