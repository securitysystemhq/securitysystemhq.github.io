IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>The most significant thing that these new IP cameras have in common is their accessibility. For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered. Among all the communications technology of alarm monitoring market, cellular wireless network expected to grow with the highest CAGR during forecast period.</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>
