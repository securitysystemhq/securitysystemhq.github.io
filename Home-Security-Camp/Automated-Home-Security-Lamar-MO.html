<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time. The city has since adopted a new partnership with General Electric in which street lights are equipped with cameras and microphones. In a large public building additional fire safety features will be required - such as ceiling sprinkler systems and elaborate communications devices - that are not required on private properties.</p>

However, a computer system equipped with video analytics software, teamed with a skilled human, can effectively monitor many cameras.

<p>We also found it easy to set up, scalable to small and large homes, and configurable with a variety of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors. In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars. Not that long ago, the only folks that could afford security cameras were James Bond, NASA and the police.</p>
<p>Homeowners can choose between a landline, broadband or cellular connected system, and the system is controlled through a base station rather than through a keypad on a control panel like most home security systems. For example, if you travel, you might need to remotely unlock your doors for family or guests, turn your lights on and off to make it look like you're home, turn your thermostat up if an extended freeze is expected, high-quality security cameras and doorbell cameras to monitor your home and property while you're not there.</p>

A:There are different types of devices available in a home surveillance system, including CCTV camera, cables, power supply and video monitors.

This way not only the alarm will alert you and everybody else in the house, but it will also let the monitoring service know that there are troubles and professional help will arrive soon.
