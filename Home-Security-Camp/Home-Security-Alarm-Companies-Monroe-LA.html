Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring technologies have also become something of a focus for the tech device industry. The standard does not require the use of heat detectors as part of the basic protection scheme, but it recommends that heat detectors be used to supplement the basic smoke detector system.
