<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
<p>This is a nice feature to have if you want to build a complete security system, but cameras aren't necessary if you just want to secure your home from intruders or monitor for emergencies.
