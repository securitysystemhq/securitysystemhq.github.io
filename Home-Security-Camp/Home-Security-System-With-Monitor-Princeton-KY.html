You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>CCTV Camera Pros has simple fixed lens models as well as high end varifocal cameras with sens-up, WDR, and on screen display controls.
