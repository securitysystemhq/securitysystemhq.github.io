<p>The siren and lights will alert the householder or neighbors that someone has broken into the house and the sound will often drive the intruder to run away quickly.

The most common alarm systems use the principle of circuits: closed and open. These are LED bulbs fitted on the camera, and switch on automatically in low light conditions and allow the camera to see in the dark in black and white images.</p>
<p>The video feed of the camera is then transmitted to a monitor or sets of monitors which you can easily view and record for surveillance purposes. For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. LifeShield's smart DIY security systems range in price from around $300 to $500, and you can get professional monitoring without a contract.
