<p>Having a home security system isn't just about protecting your home and family, it's about your peace of mind as well.

<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>We may request a written statement or report from a registered alarm company representative, which details the reasons for the false alarm.

Security cameras can be used not only to monitor the inside of a building but to survey the outside areas like car parks and perimeter fences.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR.
