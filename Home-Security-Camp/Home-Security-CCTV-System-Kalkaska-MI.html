<p>No, not all providers offer security cameras in their equipment packages. The commonest excuse for the deployment of CCTV cameras is in the prevention and detection of crime. Fire sprinklers utilize water by direct application onto flames and heat, which causes cooling of the combustion process and prevents ignition of adjacent combustibles. In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>The Pulse even allows your phone to control your outdoor security camera to see real-time activity from different angles to stay aware of your home and loved one's safety. Alarm monitoring is carried out to detect intrusion, fire, glass break, or rising carbon monoxide levels inside a premise. The center of this powerful and flexible system is its control panel, where you will program passwords, sensors and more.</p>
