<p>Wireless internet CCTV cameras, also known as wireless IP cameras, are the digital replacement for traditional analogue CCTV. From video collection only, to multi-dimensional data awareness: A Huawei Software Defined Camera (SDC) — with a full hardware series available, designed for diverse scenarios — converges cloud IoT data with media and information networks, to realize 360° awareness of people, vehicles, objects, the environment, and behaviors, mining multi-dimensional data for true value, and promising to comprehensively safeguard cities.</p>

<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control. SimpliSafe cameras work as standalone devices. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction.
