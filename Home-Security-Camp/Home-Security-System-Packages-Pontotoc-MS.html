<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>Not all companies support wireless alarm systems, but the best and most reputable companies support the technology. Even though prices are on the higher end, years of experience combined with the most monitoring centers in the land assure ADT customers get fast response times and helpful service when they need it most. Sufficient evidence has shown that CCTV surveillance systems mostly discourage crimes and robberies, but not more vicious crimes such as aggravated assault and rape.</p>
<p>D-Link IP based surveillance technology allows users to integrate audio and motion detectors into cameras, without the need for additional hardware and cabling. Security Info Watch has created a handy primer on compression technology if you're looking to delve into the details of video compression. For a huge choice of quality intruder alarms, look no further than Fire Action. Many security camera packages come with a DVR for video recording, but some don't so you may need to buy one separately.</p>

This enables the camera to send good quality images at very low light levels, although they will be in black and white when the infra-red lighting is being used, which is a side-effect of this type of light. Price shown is monthly price for entry-level professional monitoring service.</p>
