<p>Are looking for the best fire alarm system to protect your home? Another important consideration when selecting home monitoring systems is the number of ways you can control your devices. Remote monitoring should concentrate on those activities which can be reviewed and monitored remotely, such as consistency checking, data completeness, identification of sites with high error rates or protocol violations.

Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>
