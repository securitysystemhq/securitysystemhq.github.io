<p>Recently, we put some of the latest in HD IP PTZ cameras to the test in low light conditions to see which model is the superior when it comes to outdoor video surveillance in this environment The 3 cameras that were put to the test in low light conditions are the Axis Q6045-Mk11, Pelco D220, and the Hikvision Darkfighter DS-2df82233I-AEl. Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature.

<p>Detection devices run the gamut, from smoke detectors and heat detectors to multi-capability detectors, which contain a number of functions in one detector. Most companies also offer yard signs and window decals to warn potential burglars that a house is protected by an alarm service. Alternatively, your building's security system could consist of nothing more than a couple bubble cameras that only monitor hallways and office entries.</p>
