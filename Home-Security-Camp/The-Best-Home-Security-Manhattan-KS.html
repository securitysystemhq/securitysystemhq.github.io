CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
