<p>If properly utilized, remote monitoring services can act as useful IT management tools at a fraction of the maintenance cost. This is based on user preference, but many security systems are most commonly controlled by a smartphone app, so often times it is sufficient (and easier for guests) to just have a keypad and then utilize the app for controlling the system on a day-to-day basis. But if you have an alarm, get into the habit of using it every time you leave the house.</p>
<p>As well as sounding an alarm, such sensors can easily be a part of a burglar alarm with text or phone alerts. Availability of low cost cameras and ease of installation are important factors for growth of DIY cameras.
