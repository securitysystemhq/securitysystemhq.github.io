<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>When setting up lighting for an indoor or outdoor surveillance camera, it's important to make sure that the light source is not within the camera's field of view. Burglar alarm system is an innovation which assumes the liability to ensure and secure your home as well as your property.

<p>The price of professional monitoring will vary based on the equipment you choose. The two cameras show 720p HD color viewing and night vision while storing all footage on a 256GB microSD card. This means outdoor cameras must be more durable and may have additional features to meet outdoor surveillance needs; so they can be more expensive.

This effective alarm system functions very well as it can detect movements even through thick walls and can make an angry bark of a dog that gets louder and fiercer as the intruder advances. Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>
