In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

<h3>Modern Security and Surveillance Systems For Your Home in Altamonte Springs</h3>
<p>LifeShield provides home security solutions for the DIY-er and individual who prefers professional installation. What this means is that the camera can be powered and transfer video feed all with one Cat5 cable, rather than running a power cable and a separate video cable the way that analog cameras do. Another perk of using IP CCTV cameras is that the resolution that can be achieved far surpasses the video quality that can be delivered while using analog technology.</p>
<p>Some door alarms have an additional 'visitor' setting which gives a chime or bleep when the door is opened. You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
