<p>All buildings need to have fire safety equipment in order to ensure the safety of the people who occupy the building. Instead, it wirelessly transmits the video signal to a wireless receiver that is connected to your recording or viewing device. A few more advanced home security camera systems like our Alnet PC-Based DVR Systems and H.264 standalone DVR systems provide advanced remote viewing features that will even allow you to remotely record video to a PC over the internet. They are equipped with ½” CMOS progressive scan sensors which allows the device to pick up high-quality images and doesn't require an extra light source - which makes the perfect night time security surveillance camera.</p>
<p>Depending on the anticipated fire scenario, building and use type, number and type of occupants, and criticality of contents and mission, these systems can provide several main functions. Arm and disarm your home security system, view live video feeds, lock or unlock your doors, and even adjust your smart thermostat directly from your phone. ADT (US), Moni (US), Honeywell (US), Securitas (Sweden), UTC (US), Schneider (France), Johnson Controls (US), Vivint (US), Vector Security (US), and Bosch (Germany) are some of the major companies dominating the alarm monitoring market.</p>
<p>Detection devices run the gamut, from smoke detectors and heat detectors to multi-capability detectors, which contain a number of functions in one detector. Most companies also offer yard signs and window decals to warn potential burglars that a house is protected by an alarm service.
