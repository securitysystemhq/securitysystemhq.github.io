The new MV22X and MV72X have all the same great features as the rest of the MV smart camera family - wireless, built in analytics with machine learning - with twice the storage capacity.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>Wyze cameras are especially popular among folks who want simple security for dropping in. However, they do require microSD cards to record footage and can be a bit slow to log on and check-in after receiving a push notification.

<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>
