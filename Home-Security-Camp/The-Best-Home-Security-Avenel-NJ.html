<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>You still get remote viewing capabilities on the Nest mobile app, but the system only stores clips (not continuous recording). The high cost associated with the installation and maintenance of home security systems is the key factor limiting the growth of this market. Gone are the days when only business owners relied on monitoring systems to protect their property. A wireless burglar alarm system can be easily expanded to include additional motion sensors and other peripherals (smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, driveway and pool sensors, motion activated lights, etc.). A hard-wired system may be limited to the number of peripherals offered by a particular service.</p>

The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again. And by recording a wide 180-degree view whenever its motion sensor or mic are triggered, the DCS-2530L does its job quite well.</p>
