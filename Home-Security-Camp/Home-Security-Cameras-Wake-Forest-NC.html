<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>You may have to pay more for packages that come with smart home devices and capabilities. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered. Other systems using infrared technology detect motion in a room and set off an alarm. Stream live video and talk to anyone inside your home with our HD indoor security camera.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning.
