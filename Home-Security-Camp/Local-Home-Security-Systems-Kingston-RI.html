Today; however, reliable home security companies have come to realize that an audible alarm is sometimes simply not enough to completely eliminate the threat of a home invasion. Associating DVR systems along with CCTV security cameras is a brilliant idea but cabling complexities and the problem of managing of the cables will always be there.</p>
<p>All these capabilities make alarm systems more robust, not only in terms of security but also in terms of supervision flexibility. The British Security Industry Association (BSIA) estimates that, of the approximate eight million homes with alarms, 30% are audible-only alarms - alarms that ring or have a siren but are not monitored - and just 2% are remotely monitored alarms. The H.264 codec greatly reduces the size of your digital video files without compromising video quality.</p>

While false alarms will occasionally happen keeping your system well looked after, out of harm's way and with preventative measures in place, will help to minimise mistakes.
