Zephyr BT is a wearable sensor which has been used to extract heart rate information of the patients requiring continuous monitoring. At Vector Security we pride ourselves on our professional installation. While practical, some people definitely do not agree with this use of CCTV Cameras because they believe it fosters ill will and animosity between the worker and employer. His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student's video camera was moving when she filmed her family.</p>

We deal in IP CCTV, CCTV Cameras installations, Biometric systems, Fire Detection Systems which are easy to operate, highly sensitive and offer high performance.

<p>To further explain this, assume that a building's fire alarm system has 5 circuits, zones A through E, and that each circuit has 10 smoke detectors and 2 manual stations located in various rooms of each zone. The standard size is 380 TVL to 420 TVL cameras high quality up to 480 TVL to 570 TVL. Few do-it-yourself wired systems contain movement detectors, but they can usually be added as an extra. Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>
<p>The P category refers to systems installed throughout office spaces and building premises. All home monitoring cameras are password-protected. All signals converge in the fire alarm control panel which sets off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.
