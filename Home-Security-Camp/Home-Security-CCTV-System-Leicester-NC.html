<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>We are looking at the global market for Smart Edge IP Cameras and Video Analytics such as facial recognition and various video metadata forensic search.

<p>Police and Government Security - Video Surveillance cameras are used every day to in crime investigation. Our home alarm systems are not only reliable when called on, but act as a great deterrent too.

Wide-angle lenses reduce the number of cameras required to monitor your home. Other devices allow hackers to generate radio noise that can jam communications between the sensors and the hub.
