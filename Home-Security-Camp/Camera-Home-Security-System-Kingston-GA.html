<p>It's not easy for people to appreciate the fire protection materials if they haven't experienced a real fire accident. With the new ColorVu Technology, Turbo HD ColorVu Cameras render clear images at 0.0005 lux, providing critical surveillance in ultra low-light scenarios.

<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>A monitoring company will get in touch with the emergency contact for the address, check on the situation, and in emergencies, contact the police or fire department. A hidden camera surveillance system is great for the nooks and crannies of your business where covert actions may take place.
