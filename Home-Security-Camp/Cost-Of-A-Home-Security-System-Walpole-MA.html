There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>

<p>This is a kind of artificial intelligence that is called "video analytics", and is potentially beneficial for efficient use of surveillance cameras, but this technology has sometimes been significantly oversold by the surveillance camera industry. But, according to security experts, pound-for-pound, having a monitored home alarm security system, which they strongly emphasize MUST be a good and reliable brand, is perhaps the best and SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION that one could institute in having a home that scares away potential burglars and keeps them away from your home, and your family safety.</p>
