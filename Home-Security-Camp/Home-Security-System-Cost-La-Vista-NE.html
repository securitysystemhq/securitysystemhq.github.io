<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness. An annual fee is charged for alarm monitoring, this is typically paid directly to the alarm company. All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios. A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control.

When it comes to home security systems, one of the benefits is the ability to watch the footage again later in the case of a break in. Professional monitoring includes this storage in their monthly fee, but for home monitoring-based systems, you will need some type of storage.</p>
