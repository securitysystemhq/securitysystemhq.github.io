<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection.

<h3>Home Security Systems: More Than Simply Having An Alarm In Place in Globe</h3>
<p>In case of analog cameras, an encoder must be installed to transmit analog video over IP. The input from an analog camera is encoded and output a digital stream for transmission over an IP network. The alarm itself is wired in low-voltage cable, but the control panel usually needs a connection to mains electricity via a fused connection unit. Being the network supported by a structure with Internet access, all monitoring and control, and programmer settings are reachable form any part of the globe (by using several internet access equipments, with different access privileges).</p>

In my view it is the best security system with low cost of ownership. Video surveillance comes in a wide range of forms, from DIY systems that homeowners can install themselves and monitor from their smartphones with costs starting at $60, to more complex systems that include professional installation and monitoring.</p>
