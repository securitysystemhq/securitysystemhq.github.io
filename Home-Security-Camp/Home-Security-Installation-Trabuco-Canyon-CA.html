<p>When choosing a video surveillance system, you want to go with the best video quality for the buck, and with a Network IP camera, there are 10 reasons why you should consider them over 20th century CCTV cameras. However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan.

Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>

Basically, this allows your Nest Cam IQ device to shoot videos with multiple exposures, then digitally combine the images to create a more true-to-life video. To fully secure your business and the safety of your employees, you may want to also look at access control, monitored alarm systems and fire alarms.</p>
