Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Sprinkler systems can be designed and installed with almost no aesthetic impact. In the succeeding years, extra surveillance cameras may be added as the budget allows.
