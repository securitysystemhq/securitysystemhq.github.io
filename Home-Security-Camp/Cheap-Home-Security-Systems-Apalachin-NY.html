As tempting as it might be, avoid any of the too-good-to-be-true” security cameras from companies like Geeni or brandless devices available en masse on Amazon.</p>
<p>The heart of these home security devices is a control panel, operated with keypads located at key points throughout your house. From wireless to hybrid control panels, there is just the right type of alarm system waiting for you. With a wired system, all your sensors are physically connected to the alarm panel via wiring.
