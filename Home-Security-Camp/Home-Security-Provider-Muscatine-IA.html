<p>Nowadays, all buildings are required to have some sort of fire prevention system in place to ensure the safety of the building's occupants in the event of a fire. Over the past few years there has been an upward trend in terms of migration to HD cctv camera surveillance. Thanks for sharing this great article About Cameras, my opinion is every person should Buy IP Camera because advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at. Installation will also depend on the company you purchase it through; special equipment may be needed to connect you directly to the security company or emergency personnel.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that's the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>

<p>Fire alarms shorten your recovery time: Less building damage means shorter downtime until you can reopen for business. Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. In some cases, people will mount signs in their front yards alerting potential intruders that surveillance cameras are in operation. These sensors are positioned strategically around a premises and can detect motion, and trigger the alarm countdown.</p>

Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate appropriate responses.</p>
<p>The system is also subject to false alarms resulting from automobile headlights, lightning flashes and so forth, entering the receiver. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger. If you choose a DIY wireless security system, most on the market today are fairly intuitive and easy to install. Lighting plays an important role in determining whether a satisfactory video picture will be obtained with monochrome and color cameras and LLL ICCD cameras.</p>
