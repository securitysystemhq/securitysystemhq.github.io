To better understand the mechanism by which daily RM reduced all-cause and CV mortality in IN-TIME, Hindricks et al. 44 recently performed an individual patient meta-analysis (Truecoin) of three Home Monitoring trials: TRUST, ECOST, and IN-TIME (Table 1 ). The composite CV endpoints combining CV- or all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization, and the composite WHF endpoints combining WHF- or all-cause mortality and WHF hospitalization were analysed.</p>

<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>Service Providers can give their customer, the homeowner, the power to monitor and control many devices in the home: Thermostats, door locks, lighting, cameras - while at home or away. Intelligent intrusion detection is a delicate balance between responding to real security breaches and ignoring costly false alarm sources.

Different types of motion detectors or sensors are used in a variety security and safety applications.</p>
