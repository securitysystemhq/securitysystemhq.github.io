<p>Initially, fire alarm systems are designed to detect any element associated with fires. Modern line detectors are very stable and false alarms caused by animal motion, rain, fog or snow have been eliminated. Conspicuously placed cameras have been proven to reduce threats of violence and vandalism at businesses dramatically. It uses Z-Wave enabled devices to make it easy for you to automate lights, locks, thermostats, and more—no matter which level of monitoring you select. The first signal sent by your control panel will alert monitoring personnel at the central station, who will call to notify you and confirm whether it's a real emergency or a false trigger.</p>
<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it. The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>The Pulse even allows your phone to control your outdoor security camera to see real-time activity from different angles to stay aware of your home and loved one's safety.
