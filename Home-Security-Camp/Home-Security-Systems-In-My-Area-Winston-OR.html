<p>Other wireless cameras are much smaller and more covert. You can choose either a wired or wireless security camera. Whether indoors or out, wired security camera systems have one major fault - the wires can alert intruders there is a surveillance system in place, and they can potentially cut the wires to avoid detection. Its prices for equipment—like your control panel and entry sensors— are about the same as everyone else's, but those monthly monitoring service prices will deal a serious blow to your wallet.</p>

Security cameras that are equipped with motion sensors give them the capability of detecting movements. Other common causes for false alarms can relate to the system technology.
