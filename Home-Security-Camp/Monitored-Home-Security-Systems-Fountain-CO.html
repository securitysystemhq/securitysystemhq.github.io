<p>Having a CCTV camera installed in your residential and commercial areas is not a new thing. Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them — from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>

These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>You can opt for wired burglar alarm systems or can choose to have battery operated models for installation. Although, this is not an easy task, the experiments in this chapter show that, contrary to traditional detectors, video processing techniques can not only improve and accelerate the detection but also provide the analysis and the forecast of the fire.
