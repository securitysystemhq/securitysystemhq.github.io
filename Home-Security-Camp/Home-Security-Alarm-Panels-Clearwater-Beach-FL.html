<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>

You should also make sure that your local police department accepts the burglar alarm. A substantial amount of time can be saved during investigation and prosecution by using evidence from security camera footage.</p>
<p>Security cameras can often integrate with a smart home hub like Amazon Echo or Google Home. If you have caps on your internet data usage, make sure you understand how your security camera(s) could impact your monthly bill.

Oftentimes, alarm systems vary from the noisemakers to the more advanced ones.</p>
