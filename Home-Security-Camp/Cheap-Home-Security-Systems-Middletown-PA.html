Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>

<p>When you are selecting your burglar alarm system, you will have to decide what kind of sensors you want.

Not that long ago, the only folks that could afford security cameras were James Bond, NASA and the police.</p>

A category L1 system is designed for the protection of life and which has automatic detectors installed throughout all areas of the building (including roof spaces and voids) with the aim of providing the earliest possible warning. Cameras and other home automation features are also available.</p>
<p>The small size and ease of deployment of many video components and the flexibility in transmission means over short and long distances has made rapid deployment equipment for portable personnel protection systems practical and important. They also don't need to worry about creating a detailed sketch of the facility, showing exact camera type, placement, and field of view for an installer, and then ensuring that the cameras spec'd are placed in the locations intended, - heck, the salesman might even have to visit the site during installation if he specs different types of cameras in different places.</p>
