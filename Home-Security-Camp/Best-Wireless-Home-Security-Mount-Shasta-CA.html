<p>4. The primitive CCTV systems was not applied in security monitoring until 1968 when New York was first to install video cameras in an effort to fight crime. Smartfrog has developed a smart connected camera for home video monitoring applications. Remote monitoring is seen as an acceptable addition to the process. The cameras were all configured accordingly and put through their paces one by one to test all functionally of the camera as well as image quality.</p>
<p>Whilst IP CCTV has been available for around 10 years, it is only in the last few years that the technology has matured, leading to the developments in Megapixel and High Definition (HD) technology. Again, when using video surveillance systems, the idea may be to let people know that they are being watched in order to keep them in line.
