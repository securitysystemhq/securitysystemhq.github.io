<p>Home security is big business both for security and alarm companies and of course the bad guys. In phase-I that is targeted for this year, South Western Railway (SWR) has recently commissioned Video Surveillance system (CCTV) at 6 major stations - Ballari by providing 33 Cameras, Belagavi with 36 Cameras, Vasco-Da Gama with 36 Cameras, Bengaluru Cantt with 21 Cameras, Bangarpet with 36 Cameras, Hassan with 36 Camera and at 3 Stations at Hassan, Shivamogga Town & Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam, work is under progress and will be commissioned shortly.</p>
<p>Most DIY systems are easy to install and are sold as kits that you can configure to suit your specific needs. Pro Series Doorbells provide video intercom functionality, supporting communication with the master station and the indoor station. The mobile and IP communications have developed and completely changed the way we now use, monitor and control intruder security systems. After a certain number of false alarms, the police won't respond to any call-outs.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies often acquire mobile surveillance units, such as manned towers that can be raised 25-feet in the air and unmanned trailers that can extend a pole with PTZ cameras in all directions. The hospital at home ‚Äù movement driven by at-home remote monitoring technologies offers an opportunity to limit expensive hospital stays while keeping patients happily with their loved ones. Security cameras can be programmed to record scheduled events like important deliveries and crucial parts of the construction process for later on references.</p>

Surveillance systems are readily being used by governments for crime prevention and investigation, in intelligence gathering, and to protect people, objects, processes, etc. This is important because several videos reportedly taken from the campus CCTV footage have been circulating in the last few days, which show the police beating students inside the library and also breaking CCTV cameras.</p>

These aren't cheap: The company's own video doorbell costs $250 (including installation), while a self-installed video doorbell from Ring will cost you about $180 Vivint offers financing, which allows you to spread the up-front cost over time with a multiple year-contract, and told us that most customers go with this option.</p>

<p>Whilst IP CCTV has been available for around 10 years, it is only in the last few years that the technology has matured, leading to the developments in Megapixel and High Definition (HD) technology. Again, when using video surveillance systems, the idea may be to let people know that they are being watched in order to keep them in line. With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone.</p>
