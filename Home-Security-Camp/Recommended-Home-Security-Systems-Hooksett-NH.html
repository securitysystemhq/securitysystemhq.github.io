<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>You may have to pay more for packages that come with smart home devices and capabilities. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered.

You might want to consider a traditional burglar alarm system; this will give you sensors on your doors and windows, and alert you to any intruders. Look for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision. However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. Choosing the right security system for your property and budget is no easy task - there's a broad range of systems available and you are entering into a world filled with technical jargon.
