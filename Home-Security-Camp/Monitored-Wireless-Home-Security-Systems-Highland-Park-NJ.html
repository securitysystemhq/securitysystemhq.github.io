<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The center gives an edge in monitoring operations & managing maintenance of all connected sites, providing instant insights and real-time proactive action - ensuring maximum generation & uptime. With this information, the role and interaction of these supplemental fire safety systems in the protection process can then be better realized.

<p>On the minus side is the inconvenience of activating and deactivating the alarm, and the cost and problems with false alarms. Good Wi-Fi coverage is essential, and most systems will have a range of around 20-50metres, but if you have black spots around the house the system may struggle. Manual fire alarms are used to alert an entire building in the event of a fire.
