<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>Think of the alarm system connected to the door. Security cameras can keep an eye out for criminal activity, but they also give family members the ability to monitor the person and the home remotely.

Security cameras can be used not only to monitor the inside of a building but to survey the outside areas like car parks and perimeter fences.</p>
<p>The basic residential detection system, according to NFPA 74, relies primarily on the use of smoke detectors. It supports temperature, humidity and dust accumulation drift compensation and sensor fault inspection (fault reporting to fire alarm control panel).
