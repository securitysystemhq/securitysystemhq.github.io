<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>But when the door or window is opened by an intruder, the circuit will be open, thus the alarm will be triggered. A video surveillance camera can be used for other types of tests on cars. Hikvision products also provide powerful business intelligence for end users, which can enable more efficient operations and greater commercial success. Two-stage fire alarm systems warn only certain people who are authorized to take appropriate action before the second stage.</p>

Like a lot of other standard IP cameras, Smart iCam provide visual motion detection feature. IP cameras also have additional features that analog cameras don't offer, such as video analytics, which allow for mobile notifications and automatic recording if there is movement within the camera's field of vision.</p>
