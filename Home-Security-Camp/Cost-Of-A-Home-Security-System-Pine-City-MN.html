<p>Surveillance cameras on the corner of a building. 5. In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two protective light beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses and shaped to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photoelectric means and means responsive to the varying voltage for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list.
