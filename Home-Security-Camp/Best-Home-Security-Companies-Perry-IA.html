<p>Even though it is wireless, it is possible to get cameras with the system as well. For professional or public infrastructure security applications, IP video is restricted to within a private network or VPN 120 IP cameras are considered part of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) and have many of the same benefits and disadvantages as other IP-enabled devices.

Digital video surveillance systems based on the principle of binary encoding of information that improves performance reading and writing data speed, improves quality of the signal transmitted by the camera and allows off-site internet viewing.
