<p>Many cities, businesses, and individuals have installed Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras for surveillance purposes. The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>
