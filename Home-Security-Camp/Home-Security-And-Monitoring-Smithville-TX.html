<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>The new and improved Brinks Home Security uses MONI monitoring and Livewatch DIY security systems for a more modern package. There are typically two options for adding video surveillance: Pay a fee to have an alarm company install, monitor and respond to video alerts, or purchase a video surveillance system from a retail store and install it yourself. Video cameras can also help you sell more products from your retail store.</p>

In addition to perimeter sensors, many systems also include motion detectors that monitor large areas inside the house.

<p>The Value Series MDVRs support 4 channels of anolog camera inputs along with 2 SD cards for video storage. Most cameras today come with built in remote viewing apps. These video cameras can be used to help monitor the safety of elderly, babies, or the children with their nanny. Most likely, a homeowner with an active security system will never actually experience a break-in, so they will hopefully never need the full service functionality these systems provide.</p>

CCTV camera, or IP Camera can of course record audio, together with video image.
