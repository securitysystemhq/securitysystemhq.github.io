<p>Having a CCTV camera installed in your residential and commercial areas is not a new thing. Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them — from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>

All the control goes through your security DVR, so there is a time stamped recording being stored. The security burglar alarm project is designed toinform the concerned authorities about an unauthorized access to secure areas like museums, residential houses, show rooms and banks.</p>

<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Mount Pleasant</h3>
<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do. What this means to the consumers is a sharper, crisper, and more detailed picture than what is achieved with analog. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>We also found it easy to set up, scalable to small and large homes, and configurable with a variety of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors. In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars. Not that long ago, the only folks that could afford security cameras were James Bond, NASA and the police.</p>

In my view it is the best security system with low cost of ownership. Video surveillance comes in a wide range of forms, from DIY systems that homeowners can install themselves and monitor from their smartphones with costs starting at $60, to more complex systems that include professional installation and monitoring.</p>
