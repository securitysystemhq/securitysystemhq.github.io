<p>Businesses install fire alarm and fire suppression systems in their buildings and hope that they never have to use them. New developments for distributed web-based intruder alarm systems, which can include not only traditional signaling functions but also new "smart" decision functions are challenging thrills today for the intruder alarm designers. Intruder alarm systems connected through the network (second configuration). These days a burglar alarm system has become a device in great demand.
