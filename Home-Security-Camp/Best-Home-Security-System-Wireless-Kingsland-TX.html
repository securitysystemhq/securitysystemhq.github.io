<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>Motion activated cameras with DVR's are an excellent solution if you need to monitor a specific area or location such as a parking lot or parking garage. These panels range in scale from a single zone to multiple buildings. Cherry Labs has developed an AI-enabled camera that can be used for home monitoring applications. Keeping these things in mind will help to ensure that you get the best possible monitoring security system for your home and family.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>

<p>Multiple Users viewing: Multiple users could watch the live video from the same camera at the same time, clearly and smoothly. Most of the video surveillance systems installed in the US are for home and business security applications. If you take advantage of other smart home systems, you're missing out on what you can achieve with the security and surveillance component. Home security systems have the technology to prevent burglaries and deter prowlers, and monitoring adds another level of protection.</p>
