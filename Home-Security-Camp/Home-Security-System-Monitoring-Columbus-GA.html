<p>Is there any place in your plant which is not suitable for a person to stay there to monitor important process? There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>
<p>If the intruder opens the door, the circuit breaks and triggers the alarm. It has been noticed that, IP Storage Area Network is gaining traction over digital and network video recorders for storage as it proposes enhanced scalability, retention and huge storage capacity.

<p>On the minus side is the inconvenience of activating and deactivating the alarm, and the cost and problems with false alarms. Good Wi-Fi coverage is essential, and most systems will have a range of around 20-50metres, but if you have black spots around the house the system may struggle. Manual fire alarms are used to alert an entire building in the event of a fire. The system is based on coaxial or electro-magnetic sensor cable with the controller having the ability to differentiate between signals from the cable or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing the fence, or bad weather conditions.</p>
