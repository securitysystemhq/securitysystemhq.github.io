Solving Cases - Number 3 brings us here; if the cameras do not work as a crime deterrent, then the footage video surveillance systems capture can be used as evidence and help ensure that the proper arrests and prosecutions are made in case of a theft, vandalism or assault.

<p>Even though it is wireless, it is possible to get cameras with the system as well. For professional or public infrastructure security applications, IP video is restricted to within a private network or VPN 120 IP cameras are considered part of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) and have many of the same benefits and disadvantages as other IP-enabled devices.

<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages.

This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems.
