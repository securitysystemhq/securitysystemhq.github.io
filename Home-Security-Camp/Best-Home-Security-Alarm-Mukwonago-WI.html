<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Every system comes with a free app that allows you to view your cameras anywhere in the world as long as you have internet. Position your cameras strategically around the premises you want to monitor. First, there is no such thing as free home security monitoring, nor would the top security companies get together on a cross promotional activity, since they are direct competitors. So create certain that you get a home security system that can effectively protect your home and family anytime of the day, whether or not you are at home or not.</p>
