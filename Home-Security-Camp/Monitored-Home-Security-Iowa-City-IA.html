<p>Photoelectric detectors produce a beam of light, which when gets disrupted by smoke sends signals and makes sound. Although the Ring Alarm security kits and monitoring plans are probably the cheapest out there, Ring cameras and lights run from about $40 to $200 each.

Motion detectors intended for outdoor use utilise special technology that eliminates many disruptions caused from a variety of environmental factors.
