<p>A heat alarm detector must be fitted in the kitchen instead of a smoke detector to prevent nuisance activation. Honeywell's new Home system actually integrates a complete Alexa speaker and wide-angle 1080p camera into the base station, but it lacks any sort of professional monitoring service. With its appealing design, microSD storage slot and the surprise bonus of an audio out jack, this little camera is a cut above the most basic IP cameras.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

SimpliSafe's contact sensors for doors and windows are small enough to be camouflaged when installed on white trim; the motion sensor is noticeable, but not an eyesore.</p>
