<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>If a detector recognizes a condition which could be indicative of a fire, the control panel will first attempt a quick reset. Rather than initiating an alarm state, the control panel will go into a supervisory” state, if a sprinkler valve is in an off-normal” condition.

<p>Fire protection systems are complex safety systems, which must be absolutely reliable in case of emergency. The fire alarm panel activates the flashers or the sounders, turns on sprinklers (or they can be activated along with the detector), or makes a call to the authorities or to the occupants. Intelligent addressable smoke detectors are compatible with MAXLOGIC series addressable panels.
