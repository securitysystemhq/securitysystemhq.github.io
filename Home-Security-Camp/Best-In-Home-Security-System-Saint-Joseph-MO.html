Vivint offers all of today's must-have home security features (professional monitoring, top-of-the-line equipment, home automation, mobile app access) with the added benefit of extensive smart home options and flexibility with your equipment and payment plan.

For most cameras, all you need to do is follow instructions on an app to connect them to your home network.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
