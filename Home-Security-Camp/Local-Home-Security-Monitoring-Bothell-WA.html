If you are in the US, you will be captured by security cameras over 200 times a day - not a surprise if you know every 10 people in America own more than one security camera.</p>

If you get a camera with a narrow viewing angle, you should consider getting more cameras to monitor every area of your business.</p>

<p>Network cameras can be used for very cheap surveillance solutions (requiring one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV installations (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs , and CCTV monitors become computers with TFT screens and specialised software.

<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted. Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>
<p>Many security systems can add on additional security features such as infrared and sound-wave sensors. Some fully-monitored home security systems also notify your security provider's monitoring center of motion-triggered activity.
