The field of fire detection has advanced to where smoke detectors and alarm devices have combined to become life-safety systems.

<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use. In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. If you are looking for a comprehensive view of a large open area while having the ability to focus and zoom in for details at the same time, then Turbo HD PTZ Cameras are the perfect candidate.</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>
