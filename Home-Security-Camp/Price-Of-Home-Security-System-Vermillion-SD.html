Adiline Macriga, Smart Home Monitoring and Controlling System Using Android Phone, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Website: (ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 11, November 2013).</p>
<p>Generally, having a professional come and do the installation means they can also teach you more about the security system you're going to be using. The last thing that we're going to look at it is wireless security cameras. Cameras can also act as hub for other home devices by jumping onto the same wifi network. Although it can't record continuous motion (without a subscription) and often leaves gaps of a few seconds in between video clips—making it less desirable as a security camera—it is otherwise the best battery-powered unit we tested.</p>
<p>However, the supplied 10-foot power cord limits placement and isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a Nest), and notifications that distinguish between people and general motion will cost you an additional $10 per month.
