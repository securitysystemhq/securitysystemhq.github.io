<p>Every now and then you may find yourself in a position where one of your security cameras has stopped working. They can perform all the functions of a digital video recorder mentioned above and adds support for IP and megapixel cameras. Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services. Fire safety begins with fire detection, and fire detection means everything from components—sensors, initiating devices, annunciators, and control panels—to integrated systems.</p>
<p>They provide a very low false alarm rate, and have a very high chance of detecting real burglars. Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is usually a simple process, and it is often possible to bring all of your existing devices and sensors to the new wireless system. Alarms are also provided to alert building management when a sprinkler valve is closed. Mission effectiveness of a fire alarm safety system is based on four factors: Design, equipment, installation, and maintenance.</p>
<p>Most home security cameras perform the same basic functions—they detect an event, record the event, and send you an alert—but they don't all perform them the same way.
