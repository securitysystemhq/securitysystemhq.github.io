Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. Monitored home security systems cost between $20 and $60 per month. Note: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and leave out the old analog cameras, given that everyone favors IP cameras today for their affordable prices, features and easy setup.</p>

<p>Some alarm systems are designed to sound a high pitched siren, while others use strobe lights as a sign of warning to the burglar. When there is visual evidence through IP cameras, these claims can be proved either way.
