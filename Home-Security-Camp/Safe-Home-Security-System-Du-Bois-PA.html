<p>Home security is big business both for security and alarm companies and of course the bad guys. In phase-I that is targeted for this year, South Western Railway (SWR) has recently commissioned Video Surveillance system (CCTV) at 6 major stations - Ballari by providing 33 Cameras, Belagavi with 36 Cameras, Vasco-Da Gama with 36 Cameras, Bengaluru Cantt with 21 Cameras, Bangarpet with 36 Cameras, Hassan with 36 Camera and at 3 Stations at Hassan, Shivamogga Town & Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam, work is under progress and will be commissioned shortly.</p>
<p>Abode has all of the standard sensors and devices for an easy entry-level security system. However, this type of security camera is still easy to hook up with only one power cable to deal with compared with the traditional analog cameras. National and local statistics have proven that raising fines paid directly by homeowners and businesses have had no significant impact on reducing the number of false alarms.</p>
<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control.

Outdoor cameras are one of the best ways to deter (and catch) burglars, vandals, and other miscreants.</p>
<p>Even though it is wireless, it is possible to get cameras with the system as well. For professional or public infrastructure security applications, IP video is restricted to within a private network or VPN 120 IP cameras are considered part of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) and have many of the same benefits and disadvantages as other IP-enabled devices.

<p>Both Total Connect and will allow the user to remotely arm and disarm their panel, check the status of their system and control any Z-Wave devices that have been installed with the panel. This effective alarm system functions very well as it can detect movements even through thick walls and can make an angry bark of a dog that gets louder and fiercer as the intruder advances. Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
<p>The addition of VIP significantly improves the usefulness of CCTV , particularly where there are a large number of cameras installed, which an operator cannot view at the same time. The control panel's microprocessor sends a constant interrogation signal over each circuit, in which each initiating device is contacted to inquire its status (normal or emergency). Plus prior to you actually testing the system you need to walk round the house to make sure that all doors and windows are closed.</p>
<p>We are interested in market studies and forecasts about the IP video surveillance market, especially IP cameras above 1MP, defined by region, type of camera and competitor.
