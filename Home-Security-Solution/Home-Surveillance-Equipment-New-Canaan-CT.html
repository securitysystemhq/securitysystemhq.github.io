Almost anyone can look at a location and suggest a number of cameras, but only qualified technicians, like those at State Systems Inc., have the experience to recommend a camera that will give you a picture with the best definition or range of coverage for a secure and reliable system.</p>

<p>A: A DIY burglar alarm may work like any other conventional burglar alarms, but with the added benefit of using sensors and components that you consider necessary. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that may show a 360-degree view, but the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or better. There have been numerous cases where people's lives have been saved due to the smoke & fire alarms.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you connect your camera to a digital video recorder (DVR) to record your camera's footage, it will also need to be HD compatible to have crystal clear photos and videos. Nest is pricier than most other DIY home security systems, but it's a good choice if you want to monitor your system yourself. Truth is, many home security cameras and systems in the market these days are DIY types, which makes it pretty easy to install by yourself, without additional installation cost.</p>
<p>When these perimeter sensors and interior motion detectors are part of a stand-alone system, the siren and flashing lights are the only deterrents for discouraging the intruder and thwarting the break-in. ADT offers pet-immune motion detectors, wireless components for easy integration into your home, and two-way voice capabilities. Cameras that are set on potential entry points that have DVR capabilities are a great way to help law enforcement personnel identify burglars and vandals.</p>
