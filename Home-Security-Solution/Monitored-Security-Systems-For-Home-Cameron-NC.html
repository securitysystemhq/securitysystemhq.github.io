<p>In this instance, we're talking about home security systems, which are networks of integrated electronic devices working together with a central control panel to protect against burglars and other potential home intruders.

Smoke and fire detectors that aren't wired directly into your alarm system cannot summon emergency personnel.</p>

You might want to consider a traditional burglar alarm system; this will give you sensors on your doors and windows, and alert you to any intruders. Look for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision. However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>
