Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded.

For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered. Among all the communications technology of alarm monitoring market, cellular wireless network expected to grow with the highest CAGR during forecast period.</p>

Several security systems offer integrations with popular voice activation hubs like Amazon Alexa, but experts predict companies that are moving toward voice controls will become obsolete. That means you can add, for example, a smart speaker to arm, disarm, and check system status with the sound of your voice, as well as trigger cameras or lights to go on based on alerts or your location.</p>
<p>Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
