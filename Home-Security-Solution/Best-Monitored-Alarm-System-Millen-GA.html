Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>
<p>The best home security systems use tools and technology to help keep you, your family, and your property safe. These systems consist of a central control panel to which smoke alarms and heat detectors are connected, along with bells or horns that are activated when the system triggers an alarm.
