<p>Motion sensing cameras can send an alert to your security company or your smartphone app when they are triggered, allowing you to get a feed just at the moment you need it, rather than all the time. A:Most companies do not give a lot of time when the alarm is first activated to when you personally disarm it. If you haven't disarmed it in this given time frame, the monitoring center would receive your information in about 10 seconds or as specified by your home security company.</p>
<p>For this reason, most fire alarm systems are designed with one or more manual alarm activation devices to be used by the person who discovers a fire.

The HD cameras can be set with a very specific monitoring zone, so there's no need for traditional two-piece door or window sensors. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.</p>
<p>A fire alarm panel is generally pricier than its more traditional counterpart, which is the smoke alarm. Home security companies are giving customers plenty of choices for equipment and services.
