<p>Fire alarms shorten your recovery time: Less building damage means shorter downtime until you can reopen for business. Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. In some cases, people will mount signs in their front yards alerting potential intruders that surveillance cameras are in operation.
