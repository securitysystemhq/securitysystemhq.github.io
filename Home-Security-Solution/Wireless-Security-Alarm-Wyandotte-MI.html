Alder does not have a selection of pre-made packages you can choose from, but works with customers to build out security systems that are best for their homes. In more complex buildings such as retail premises, where the evacuation system is based on staged or phased evacuation, or where people are unfamiliar with the fire warning arrangements, the landlord or employer might consider installing a voice evacuation system.</p>

From a practical perspective, wireless systems have more flexibility if you may move or don't want to put holes in walls.
