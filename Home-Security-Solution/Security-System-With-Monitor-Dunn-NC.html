<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>

<p>If you're only concerned with protection against home intruders, for instance, you don't need a home burglar alarm which will also let you notify the fire department incase of a home fire or emergency services for help following an accident or health emergency. The advantage of conventional systems is that they are relatively simple for small to intermediate size buildings. The ADT Pulse monitoring service starts at $28.99 per month and requires a three-year contract, but you also have to figure in the cost of things like hardware components, cellular backup, and installation.</p>
<p>Many security systems can add on additional security features such as infrared and sound-wave sensors. Some fully-monitored home security systems also notify your security provider's monitoring center of motion-triggered activity. Therefore, in a business environment I want my cameras highly visible, and if possible I want a big color monitor where all my patrons can see that I have the entire facility under surveillance, including them, and that the pictures are sharp, in color, and with a close enough view to make identification undeniable.</p>
