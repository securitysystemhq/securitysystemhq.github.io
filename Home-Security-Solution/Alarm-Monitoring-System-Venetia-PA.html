Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
<p>One of the most popular and cost effective ways of providing security in the home and place of work is with cctv cameras and equipment.

<p>Our company offers its clients high quality range of CCTV IR Camera. Basic units are usually just a transmitter and receiver pair, whereas higher end units can have multiple cameras on a single receiver.

CCTV camera images are an important means of traffic surveillance that complements other traffic control measures.</p>
<p>DVR stands for digital video recording, whereas NVR stands for network video recording. Fire detection systems are designed to discover fires early in their development when time will still be available for the safe evacuation of occupants.
