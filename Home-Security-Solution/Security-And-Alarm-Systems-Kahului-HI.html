Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. In rural applications, where reliable sprinkler water supplies can be expensive, mist systems may be comparable or less than standard sprinklers.</p>
