<p>Have you ever noticed that your fire alarm or your smoke alarm goes off every time you cook? We constantly push the boundaries of technology to develop intelligent solutions that go beyond the highest security demands of today and deliver clear business advantages beyond security. In this case individual plug in power supplies are used to power them with power cable running as separate and independent line to the camera. Some of the lower-quality home security systems come with only basic door and window sensors that customers can easily install themselves.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensors and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment.
