<p>Many people share a grave misconception about the use and application of fire alarm systems. This security camera is pretty generic and provides a decent quality of about 720p resolution. Closed circuit television is one of the most effective and commonly used types of video surveillance available on the market, but is a step above in price from wireless cameras. It's great value for the money, and you can even try it for free for 15 days to see if you like the equipment, monitoring, and service. The misinformation of the fire alarm caused by water mist or oil smoke causes unnecessary losses to people.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarmâ€”if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>
<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control.
