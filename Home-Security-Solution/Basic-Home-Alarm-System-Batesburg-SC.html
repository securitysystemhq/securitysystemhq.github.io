There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>
<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems. Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away.
