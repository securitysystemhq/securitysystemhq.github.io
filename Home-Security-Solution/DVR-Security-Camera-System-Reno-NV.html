Coax is stiff, larger than other cables, and incapable of transmitting audio, so DVR systems often have to run large amounts of cabling through walls and ceilings to connect each camera to the DVR.</p>
<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself. But there are also several drawbacks when you opt to use a smoke alarm instead of the fire alarm panel.
