<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

The detector identifies any smoke or heat in the building or if someone uses the manual breakpoint. It is sometimes the case where an alarm panel or wiring is attacked by an intruder and oftentimes the equipment is damaged beyond repair.</p>
