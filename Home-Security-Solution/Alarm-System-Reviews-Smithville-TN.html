<p>The most important characteristics of an effective burglar alarm system are its accuracy in identifying the correct alarm outputs to assure quick and correct responses and the unit's accuracy in communicating with the security service provider. From a practical perspective, wireless systems have more flexibility if you may move or don't want to put holes in walls. Most of our surveillance systems include DVR viewer software for Windows and Mac PCs, as well as mobile surveillance viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.</p>
