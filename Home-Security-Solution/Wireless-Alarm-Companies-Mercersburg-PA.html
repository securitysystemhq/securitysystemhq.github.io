<p>Practically all buildings and a lot of homes these days have fire alarm systems. You need to purchase a base station in addition to the camera, which makes the up-front cost more hefty than other cameras. Devices that come with the SimpliSafe system include the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensor and HD video quality, and a keychain remote used to arm or disarm the system.

Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>

Having such features will enable you more flexibility with remote or voice controls and without having to physically handle these systems manually.</p>
