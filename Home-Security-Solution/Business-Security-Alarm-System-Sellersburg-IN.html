<p>All buildings need to have fire safety equipment in order to ensure the safety of the people who occupy the building. Instead, it wirelessly transmits the video signal to a wireless receiver that is connected to your recording or viewing device. A few more advanced home security camera systems like our Alnet PC-Based DVR Systems and H.264 standalone DVR systems provide advanced remote viewing features that will even allow you to remotely record video to a PC over the internet. They are equipped with ½” CMOS progressive scan sensors which allows the device to pick up high-quality images and doesn't require an extra light source - which makes the perfect night time security surveillance camera.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
<p>All these sensors work in tandem with other sensors and the IP camera so that the central control device sends warnings and notifications to your smartphones. The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm. In one, New York City police in a helicopter supposedly monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared video camera on an amorous couple enjoying the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop balcony.</p>

<p>Most outdoor cameras, like our current top pick, the Arlo Ultra , offer motion detection with push and email notifications, night vision, and cloud storage for event-triggered video, and some, like the Ring Floodlight Cam , pull double duty as floodlights or porch lights.
