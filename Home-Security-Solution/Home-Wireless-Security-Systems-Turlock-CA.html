Vivint offers all of today's must-have home security features (professional monitoring, top-of-the-line equipment, home automation, mobile app access) with the added benefit of extensive smart home options and flexibility with your equipment and payment plan. But a lot of this video is low-quality, so they're also shooting their own training footage with actors. For most cameras, all you need to do is follow instructions on an app to connect them to your home network.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house.

The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
