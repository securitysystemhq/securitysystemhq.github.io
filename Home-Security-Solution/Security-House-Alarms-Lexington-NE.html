The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
