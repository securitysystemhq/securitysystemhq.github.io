<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off. Without the cable keeping lights, alarms, and sprinkler systems operating, tragedies are going to happen. This feature allows you to disable the interior motion sensors but leaves the perimeter sensors active for the best in home security. DVRs generally offer what is known as D1 resolution, which is the traditional video quality used in closed-circuit television systems.</p>
<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely. They are great for those in rented accommodation as they can be removed just as easily as they were installed so when you move on to your new home, you can take the alarm system with you. Fire alarms reduce property loss: While strobe lights and sirens don't actively put out fires, they alert the people who can.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at. You can never tell by looking at it in distance. One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally.
