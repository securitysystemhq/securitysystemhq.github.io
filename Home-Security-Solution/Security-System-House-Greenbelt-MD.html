<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad.

Most sprinkler systems also include an alarm to alert occupants and emergency forces when sprinkler activation (fire) occurs.</p>
<p>In such cases, the only option remains is the burglar alarm systems; these alarm systems are electronic alarms designed to alert a user from unspecific danger. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery. The system used for a linear burglar alarm is built on an unreceptive detection technique by means of infrared device, radio frequency reception and transmission and human-engineered digital electronic apparatus.</p>

This means it can be used in open areas to provide early warning in environments where temperature extremes may exceed the capability of other types of smoke detectors. PIR motion detectors are set so that the control box will not sound the alarm immediately they detect body heat.</p>

Provides information about applications of smoke detectors used in conjunction with fire alarm systems.
