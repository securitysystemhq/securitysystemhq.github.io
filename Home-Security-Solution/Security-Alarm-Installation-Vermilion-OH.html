<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Allowing this data to do far more for businesses than security alone. Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Comcast, Verizon, and Cisco are among those enabling the networks with technologies like cloud services, broadband connectivity, or video surveillance software. Also, like standard systems, one or more alarm initiating devices may be located along these circuits. ADT Security Monitoring + ADT Home and Life Safety Monitoring services.</p>

A fire alarm system will initiate communications to other building automation and security systems to facilitate evacuation from the building and containment of the fire.</p>
<p>All companies and businesses should regularly carry out routine tests on their fire alarms but, in the UK, The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 also requires that fire alarm systems are properly tested and maintained, and the best way to do this is to use the services of an electrical contractor.

In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service.
