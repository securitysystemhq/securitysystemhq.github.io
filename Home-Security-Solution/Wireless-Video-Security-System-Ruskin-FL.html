As stated earlier, there are basically three types of home security alarms: do-it-yourself (DIY) alarms, mid-level alarms and high-end ones. Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
