<p>The company wanted to create a comprehensive security device without using wi-fi-connected cameras, which are controversial but increasingly common thanks to product families like the Google-owned Nest and Amazon's Ring. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>An alarm user shall not be fined more than $200 for false alarms that occur at the same premises in any 24-hour period.

The security burglar alarm project is designed toinform the concerned authorities about an unauthorized access to secure areas like museums, residential houses, show rooms and banks.</p>
