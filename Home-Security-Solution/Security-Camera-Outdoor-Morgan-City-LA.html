<p>After much speculation by many integrators to which camera provided the best low light images, our team decided it was time to put this to the test and find out which of these three products provided the superior low light capabilities. Surveillance cameras are ideal for monitoring your home, especially if you have children and pets, even if you're not at home - there are surveillance cameras that allow homeowners to use their computers and mobile phones to view security images.</p>

<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
