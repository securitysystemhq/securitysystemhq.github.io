<p>This kit comes with a base station, 1-keypad, 5-contact sensors, 2-motion detectors, and a range extender. The EU's Data Protection Directive regulates access to personal data including CCTV recordings. For example the cost savings associated with crimes averted through camera systems in a city of USA saved over four dollars for every dollar spent on the technology, while another city yielded a 50 cent return on the dollar.</p>
