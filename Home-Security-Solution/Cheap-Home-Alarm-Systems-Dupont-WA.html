An example of this is infrared motion detectors (sometimes called PIR motion sensors, or passive infrared sensors). After the control panel receives a signal for an initiating device and goes into an alarm state, the panel initiates output devices that signal to building occupants that there is an emergency situation.</p>
<p>A wired camera has a video cable that transmits the video signal from the camera to a recording or viewing device. The detectors in a zone (or area) of the building are all connected to the same pair of wires. We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation. Integrated remote monitoring solutions with messaging and alert systems can let providers know when patients are in stable or critical conditions without the need for hospital room.</p>
