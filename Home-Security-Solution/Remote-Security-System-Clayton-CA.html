<p>If you are serious about home security then you will at least need an Outdoor CCTV Camera. Cameras include Greet for the front door, Pivot for indoor monitoring, Torch Pro for lighting up and monitoring outdoors. ADT Motion Sensor Protection embeds advanced safety methods into your home security system. Wireless video surveillance has become an important and integral part of our security system.

I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>

Wired cameras are hard wired to the security system, meaning you need to physically string power and data cables from a central hub or recording device to each individual camera.</p>
<p>The EZVIZ outdoor security camera uses a 360-degree swivel mounted from the ceiling to show all angles of your home. It makes high-end equipment, it offers a bunch of smart home devices, and it's ahead of the curve when it comes to innovative features. Perhaps this is no better demonstrated than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had changed since he took on the role in 2014, with the growth of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more.</p>

That means you can add, for example, a smart speaker to arm, disarm, and check system status with the sound of your voice, as well as trigger cameras or lights to go on based on alerts or your location.</p>
<p>When running the cable it is good practice to leave couple of loops of extra cable at both camera and monitoring locations.
