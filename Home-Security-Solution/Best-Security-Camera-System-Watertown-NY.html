<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit.

<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system. For a fairly modest outlay, this security camera delivers a reliable performance - provided you use the Ethernet cable, because Wi-Fi connectivity can be flaky - and a good set of features.
