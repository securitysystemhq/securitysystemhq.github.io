<p>4. The primitive CCTV systems was not applied in security monitoring until 1968 when New York was first to install video cameras in an effort to fight crime. Smartfrog has developed a smart connected camera for home video monitoring applications. Remote monitoring is seen as an acceptable addition to the process.

<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>For instance, to handle the needs of outdoor surveillance, you must ensure that the security cameras system that you are planning to buy is weatherproof.
