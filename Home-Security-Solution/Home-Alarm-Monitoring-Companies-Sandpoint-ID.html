The San Diego Police Department hoped to gain access to footage from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego” surveillance program As of 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility problems, and officers had difficulty viewing footage in real time because the department's police cruisers did not have a 4G connection.</p>

<p>You can also ramp up your security level with more sophisticated add-ons such as a closed-circuit camera system for full monitoring inside your home and out.
