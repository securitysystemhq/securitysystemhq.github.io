Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>

Intelligent intrusion detection is a delicate balance between responding to real security breaches and ignoring costly false alarm sources. A properly selected sprinkler will detect the fire's heat, initiate alarm, and begin suppression within moments after flames appear.</p>
