<p>While outdoor cameras are really useful devices, have you ever wondered how they work? Provide cellular connectivity and management support, making them ideal for use in remote patient monitoring, clinical trials or for health visitors and social workers. For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, causing more than 100 of the cameras to go dark.
