<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks.

Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe promoted the use of CCTV , saying that cameras should be installed by homeowners and businesses to help detectives solve crimes. If your CCTV security cameras at home are positioned in all possible entries a thief might use, the likelihood of recording their movements, their physical build, and even their faces are high but seizing them on the spot before they can cry uncle is not always successful.</p>
<p>Higher resolution cameras typically cost about $50 to $300 more than lower resolution versions. Our remote monitoring is not restricted to cardiac arrhythmia management.

Our dome security camera simply plugs in and begins to record security video day or night.
