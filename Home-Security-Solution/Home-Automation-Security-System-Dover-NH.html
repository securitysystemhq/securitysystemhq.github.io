<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use.

<p>Among the sales arguments advanced for the burglar alarm, one of the strongest was that maintenance costs for the system were extremely low. Retail establishments use video surveillance to monitor what customers do.
