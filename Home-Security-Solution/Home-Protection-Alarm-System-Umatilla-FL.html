Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

Two-stage fire alarm systems warn only certain people who are authorized to take appropriate action before the second stage.</p>

The best place to find a suitable home security alarm monitoring company is to go online and research companies offering this service in your immediate location.
