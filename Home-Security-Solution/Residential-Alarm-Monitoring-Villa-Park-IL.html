<p>New businesses like Milestone Systems built Video Management Systems, or VMS, to organize video information into databases. The demand for the CCTV cameras has increased in popularity. The controllers enable the expansion of the system with additional wireless devices, e.g. detectors. Wireless subsystems are ideal for use in each case where any additional wiring is unacceptable, e.g. due to aesthetic reasons.</p>
<p>If the fire alarm system is addressable, the source of the occurrence will be pointed on the control panel. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.

<p>Most modern home security systems or house alarms have been developed to provide maximum security. With the built-in GPS & Bluetooth module and the internal HD camera, the PVR provides multiple functionalities, such as positioning, picture capturing, video and audio recording, a walkie-talkie function and more. Like indoor security cameras, they can be integrated as part of a home security system or used individually to up the security level around your home.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in many circumstances wherein a CCTV surveillance system is in place, wrongdoers commonly shy away from these monitored places because they fear prosecution and any recorded images involving their presence can be used in court. This IP surveillance camera system uses multiple fixed contextual view cameras with one moving PTZ camera, to simplify permanent and temporary deployment options, for CCTV security, people surveillance and traffic management.</p>
<p>For this reason, most fire alarm systems are designed with one or more manual alarm activation devices to be used by the person who discovers a fire. The Pan Tilt and Zoom Cameras (PTZ) can be remotely controlled to pan (left or right), tilt (up and down) or zoom in to an object or revert back to wide-angle for a larger field of view. Remote Monitoring Service is an easy-to-use, secure, real-time web-based service that functions as a second set of eyes into the health and status of your company's physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Disaster security devices include things like smoke alarms, carbon monoxide (CO) sensors, and flood sensors.
