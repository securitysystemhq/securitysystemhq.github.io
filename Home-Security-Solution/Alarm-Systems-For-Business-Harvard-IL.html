<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>DC Power Splitter - 1 to 2 Y Cable This DC Power Adapter Y Cable Pigtail splits 1 power signal into 2 and is useful for powering multiple cameras from one central adapter. A disadvantage is that for large buildings, they can be expensive to install because of the extensive amounts of wire that are necessary to accurately monitor initiating devices. It allows users to remotely store, manage, record, play, and monitor surveillance footage entirely on the cloud or on secure servers.</p>
<p>This is a kind of artificial intelligence that is called "video analytics", and is potentially beneficial for efficient use of surveillance cameras, but this technology has sometimes been significantly oversold by the surveillance camera industry. But, according to security experts, pound-for-pound, having a monitored home alarm security system, which they strongly emphasize MUST be a good and reliable brand, is perhaps the best and SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION that one could institute in having a home that scares away potential burglars and keeps them away from your home, and your family safety.</p>

On the other hand, security cameras require a more detailed view, as the footage is seen later and is needed to present evidence in the court. If an alarm-monitoring company decides to pass along the cost of the individual alarm fee to subscribers, each subscriber must be provided a copy of its policies and practices with respect to the billing of this fee, including information about any administrative charges added to the license fees.</p>

These are most commonly seen in offices and other businesses, but can work effectively as a home security surveillance system as well. All of the self-installed systems I tested can function without a monitoring plan, but then they are limited to just sounding an alarm inside your home and in some cases, pushing a notification to your phone and lack the ability to automatically dispatch authorities or emergency personnel.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras will catch the thief before, or during the process of committing the crime. Based on all fire code criteria and the building worksheet it is determined that additional information is necessary to conclude with certainty that removal of any portion or all of the fire alarm system will not adversely affect either the compliance of the building or the function of other life safety systems in the building.</p>
<p>The fire alarm system must communicate with and control its system components and it must also communicate with offsite facilities and organizations such as the fire department and emergency services.
