<p>The basic residential detection system, according to NFPA 74, relies primarily on the use of smoke detectors. It supports temperature, humidity and dust accumulation drift compensation and sensor fault inspection (fault reporting to fire alarm control panel). The proposed Fire alarm system is a real-time monitoring system that detects the presence of smoke in the air due to fire and captures images via a camera installed inside a room when a fire occurs.</p>

<h3>5 Reasons To Install a Video Security Camera System In Your Home in Clarence Center</h3>
<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard drive. In addition to giving you peace of mind, a monitored home security system can reduce the chance you'll be a victim of a burglary by 300 percent and could save you up to 20 percent on your homeowners insurance.</p>
<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>Currently, many buses in a city have installed High-Definition (HD) camera systems to monitor in bus conditions. Wireless IP cameras have the capability to record to a SD card when the camera is motion activated. STMicroelectronics provides system level know-how and offers a complete set of semiconductor products to implement any smart alarm devices, thanks to complete range of precise sensors, ultra-low power solutions also for wireless connectivity, optimizing and drastically reducing energy consumption.</p>
