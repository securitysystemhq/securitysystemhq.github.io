<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>O2I's remote monitoring and management service is a proactive, real-time, web-based service that works as a set of eyes to constantly oversee the health and condition of your firm's IT infrastructure.

<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>

Once an image has been picked by the camera, it is taken to the monitor and then recorded on video tape or DVR. And this cost is usually only the equipment cost, which is pretty much especially for those people with a tight budget. Coax based cameras produce video that is encoded by the DVR, thus allowing picture quality to be modified before the video is saved by the DVR.</p>

<p>Section from our smart video doorbell guide. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company. In contrast, with a wireless system , the sensors relay information to the alarm panel via radio signals meaning cables are unnecessary.
