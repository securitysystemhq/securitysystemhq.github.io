However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan. Dome cameras are typically used for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The central module connects at the Internet via WiFi and through an application we can remotely monitor the state of the house or control various devices within the enclosure.
