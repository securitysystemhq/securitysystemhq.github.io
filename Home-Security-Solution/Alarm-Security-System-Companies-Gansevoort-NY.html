However, generally most alarm systems work similarly. There have long been well-established rules governing the audio recording of individuals without their consent (there is a reason surveillance cameras never have microphones).</p>
<p>The system can be armed or disarmed using wireless remote control that can also be used as panic switch to alert neighbors in case of medical emergency or physical attacks or robberies. If power goes out, or the internet or cellular uplink goes down, the best security systems are designed to stay connected to the monitoring center (or send out an alarm) if the connection is disrupted. Here are the two common types of security alarms.</p>
