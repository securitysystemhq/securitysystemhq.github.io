An Intelligent Video Surveillance system basically censored the performance, happenings, or changing information usually in terms of human beings, vehicles or any other objects from a distance by means of some electronic equipment (usually digital camera).</p>
<p>The experimental results show that, based on the proposed intelligent smoke alarm system, the air condition can be more accurately distinguished, and the probability of false alarms is greatly reduced, so that the air information can be viewed in real time and the alarm information can be received in a timely manner. The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Wired cameras are the standard for this technology. Make sure your fire detection, protection and extinguishing systems function properly before or when fire breaks out. The basic set-up includes a standard security keypad, 2 door or window sensors, 1 motion detector, 1 interior siren, 1 master control panel, security yard signs and labels.
