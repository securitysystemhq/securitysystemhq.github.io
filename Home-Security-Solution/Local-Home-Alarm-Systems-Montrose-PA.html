Activation of a burglar alarm circuit is made when the switch detects the opening or closing of the circuit, for example opening a door or window.</p>
<p>A fire ignition in one of the rooms monitored by zone "A" causes a smoke detector to go into alarm. If this type of smoke detector goes into alarm it will trigger the alarm and sound the horn or siren that is connected to it. If the system is monitored the authorities will be notified. Whether you need a system to protect your home or business, you can depend on surveillance video systems to document everything that happens on your property.</p>
