In a protective alarm system, a light source, an optical system for dividing light from said source into a plurality of beams extending across an area to be protected comprising a pair of mirrors and a pair of lenses cooperating therewith, said mirrors deflecting said light to a point in space, a photo-cell for receiving said light, a light chopper for normally passing a constant quantity of light and passing a varying quantity of light when one beam is intercepted by an intruder in said area and signal means responsive to said varying light.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>This can help to prevent numerous false alarms that a smoke detector may produce. Analog camera systems are affordable and can be sufficient for remote monitoring depending on the application.

<p>Remote monitoring is nowadays increasingly being used to provide secure and real-time monitoring of a company's physical infrastructure.
