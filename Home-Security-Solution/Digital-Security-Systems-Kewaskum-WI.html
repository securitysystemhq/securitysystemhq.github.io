<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>Today in market two types of Fire detection systems are available, as per your requirement, like as where you have need to instal its, suppose you have requirement for smaller systems or under with budget requirement, In this way a A Conventional type Fire Alarm System is often your best choice.

<p>All the components of the system are interconnected using many cameras for critical sites, by means of IP mega pixel cameras. There are two types of security cameras systems, Analog and IP (sometimes refered to as network cameras).

<p>There are currently four basic types of FACP panels on the market: coded panels, conventional panels, addressable panels, and multiplex systems. The advantage with the smoke detector equipment is that it will alert you previous and quicker information when there is a possibility of fire occurrence at home or office. Many security companies offer dummy alarm boxes or security cameras, which may seem like a cheap and easy way to deter intruders.</p>

Indoor vs. outdoor cameras. Compensates for pictures or video which has multiple sources of bright spots or different level of bright sports or low light spots.</p>
<p>The engineer and fire alarm technicians - as part of making the fire alarm design - will review the specifications on each property and determine where the fire alarms should go to maximize their efficiency and allow for the greatest safety assurances. As for burglar alarm systems, you can find systems that are dedicated to a particular purpose only.

In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars. Not that long ago, the only folks that could afford security cameras were James Bond, NASA and the police.</p>
<p>The fire alarm system must communicate with and control its system components and it must also communicate with offsite facilities and organizations such as the fire department and emergency services. Program Arduino to sense the data from all the three sensors and send these data to raspberry pi through serial communication.
