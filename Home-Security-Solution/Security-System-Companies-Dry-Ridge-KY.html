<p>With the continual increase in theft, burglary and vandalism, crime is something everyone thinks about. Bottom Line: The Abode iota is an easy-to-install all-in-one security system loaded with features including a 1080p camera, a motion sensor, multiple wireless radios, a built-in siren, and support for many third-party devices and platforms.

Sufficient evidence has shown that CCTV surveillance systems mostly discourage crimes and robberies, but not more vicious crimes such as aggravated assault and rape.</p>
<p>Unlike competitors that focus purely on security, Abode Iota also serves as a smart home controller. Those who prefer to get hold of the wired versions may need to put in considerable amount of work as the installation of these wired security systems entail wiring positioning and drilling of holes.
