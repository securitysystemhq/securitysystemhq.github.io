<p>With the use of video surveillance cameras, companies can keep an eye on employee's on-the-job performance and their use of company time. Our security camera systems are based on this simple principle to allow easy video download to a USB drive and playback on a Windows or Mac computer. If any one of these systems is malfunctioning, the monitor can make you aware of the situation and dispatch service personnel to your home to make sure your system continues to function.</p>
<p>All these capabilities make alarm systems more robust, not only in terms of security but also in terms of supervision flexibility. The British Security Industry Association (BSIA) estimates that, of the approximate eight million homes with alarms, 30% are audible-only alarms - alarms that ring or have a siren but are not monitored - and just 2% are remotely monitored alarms. The H.264 codec greatly reduces the size of your digital video files without compromising video quality.</p>
