<p>From the simplest application, viewing data through the web-browser on your iPhone, Blackberry device or laptop, to more sophisticated uses, such as sending a text or e-mail message when an alarm occurs, or transmitting a data log file over the internet from a remote location to a central office. Battery and cellular backup: Battery backup is a premium feature on many security cameras. In IN-TIME, the use of a central monitoring unit in addition to frequent transmissions was instrumental in facilitating early treatment adjustments.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
