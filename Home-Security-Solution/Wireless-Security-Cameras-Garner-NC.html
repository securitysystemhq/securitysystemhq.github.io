IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>

For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. LifeShield's smart DIY security systems range in price from around $300 to $500, and you can get professional monitoring without a contract. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area.</p>
