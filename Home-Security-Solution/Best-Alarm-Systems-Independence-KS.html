When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>

<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself.
