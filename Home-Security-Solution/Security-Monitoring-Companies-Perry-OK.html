Cloud based storage is another option, which means you don't need to deal with equipment; the video is uploaded directly to the cloud.</p>

If you are looking for a full proof security system to protect your house, you can use the combination of the motion detectors and open or closed circuit alarms. It's never an easy task to evacuate people from really large buildings, even with the latest in fire alarm design. If you are concerned that an audible deterrent is not merely enough security for your needs then monitored security systems provide added assurance and peace of mind that someone is monitoring your home 24 hours a day and should your alarm be triggered, help will be on its way.</p>
