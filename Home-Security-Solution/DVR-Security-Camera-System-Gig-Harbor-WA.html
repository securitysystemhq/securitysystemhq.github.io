When installing wireless security cameras, keep in mind that the smart home camera you buy will only be as good as the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the location where you plan to install it. So before you drill holes in your walls or otherwise mess up your doorframe, brick or siding, check your Wi-Fi speed If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll notice significant lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other delays that make security cameras a pain to use.</p>

<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems.
