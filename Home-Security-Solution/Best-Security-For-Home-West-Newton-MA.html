<p>Hidden cameras and spy cameras are becoming increasingly popular for use in home security. Major players in the home security system market are ADT (US), Honeywell (US), Johnson Controls (US), HANGZHOU HIKVISION DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY (China), ASSA ABLOY (Sweden), SECOM (Japan), Robert Bosch (Germany), United Technologies (US), Godrej & Boyce (India), (US), Allegion (Republic of Ireland), Control4 (US), Schneider Electric (France), Legrand (France), ABB (Switzerland), Comcast (US), STANLEY Convergent Security Solutions (US), Nortek Security & Control (US), FRONTPOINT (US), and Vivint (US).</p>

In the event of an intrusion or life safety event, the alarm siren on the ADT Security Hub will be activated and an alert will be sent to your smartphone but ADT will not be notified.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. While wireless home security systems are popular and known for an easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more reliable because they aren't subject to interference.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the existing lighting in the areas where you want to install security cameras.

<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself. But there are also several drawbacks when you opt to use a smoke alarm instead of the fire alarm panel. The rising awareness regarding the benefits of CCTV cameras in commercial sector is also increasing the demand for CCTV cameras. You can easily add additional sensors, and removing the system when you move house is a lot less tricky than for wired versions.</p>
