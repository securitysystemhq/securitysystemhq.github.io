Activation of a burglar alarm circuit is made when the switch detects the opening or closing of the circuit, for example opening a door or window.</p>
<p>A fire ignition in one of the rooms monitored by zone "A" causes a smoke detector to go into alarm.

Whether you need a system to protect your home or business, you can depend on surveillance video systems to document everything that happens on your property.</p>
