<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>

<p>Heat detectors or additional smoke detectors can supplement the basic system. Award-winning monitoring is always close by with the Vivint Smart Hub 's two-way talk.
