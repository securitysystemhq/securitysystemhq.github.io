<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>You will also need to choose which installation option you prefer for your alarm system: professional or DIY. For example, if a customer claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, or that an employee was rude or provided misinformation, video surveillance records can be used to determine whether they were in the store on the day in question, and what, in fact, took place. SiteService remotely connects to any AK SC 255, AK SC 355, or AK SM 800 series Danfoss control system and gives you a full visualization of live plant status, alarm management, system performance history, and component settings.</p>

Hard-wired smoke detectors need to have a battery backup or some other backup power source to keep them running.</p>
<p>The amount and quality of data stored on storage media is subject to compression ratios, images stored per second, image size and is effected by the retention period of the videos or images. Wireless CCTV cameras - Wireless security cameras are either IP based or have soother modes of transmitting images wirelessly.

<p>Both Total Connect and will allow the user to remotely arm and disarm their panel, check the status of their system and control any Z-Wave devices that have been installed with the panel. This effective alarm system functions very well as it can detect movements even through thick walls and can make an angry bark of a dog that gets louder and fiercer as the intruder advances. Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
