In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting 65 light across said opening, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a photo-cell arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, said optical system comprising two mirrors 701 adapted to deflect said light beams onto said photo-cell, a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage and means responsive to the varying voltage to operate an alarm system.</p>
<p>We are going to focus on cameras that can be placed in the home for surveillance. The following regulatory documents apply to the fire alarm system as opposed to individual smoke alarms of the residential type, even when they are AC powered and used for group operation.

Smoke information classification solves the problem of low accuracy of traditional smoke alarms. Some dummy cameras do have added features such as a cable that can be fitted into a conduit to make it look even more real and I do think this is a good idea.</p>
