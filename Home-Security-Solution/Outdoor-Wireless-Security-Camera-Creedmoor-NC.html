<p>The Fire Prevention Division is a group of firefighters who are the ones that go around to buildings and do a fire alarm inspection and other kinds of building checks. In the event that you are away, the home security monitoring company can organize to dispatch an alarm response guard and organize to have any break and enter damage to your property repaired immediately.

Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>More recently, decentralized IP cameras , perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation. It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.

<p>We usually think of surveillance cameras as digital eyes, watching over us or watching out for us, depending on your view. Huawei HoloSens Intelligent Video & Data Analytics — built on Huawei's cutting-edge AI technologies and accumulated expertise in big data, the cloud, and 5G — revolutionizes the video surveillance industry, transforming it from a model of simple video collection, to one of 360° data awareness, moving from basic perception toward smart foresight and intelligent prediction.</p>
