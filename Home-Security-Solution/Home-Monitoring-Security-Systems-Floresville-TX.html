<p>Is there any place in your plant which is not suitable for a person to stay there to monitor important process? There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety. In fact, I can't recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire. In the event of an intrusion or life safety event, the alarm siren on the ADT Security Hub will be activated and an alert will be sent to your smartphone but ADT will not be notified.</p>
<p>The newest technology in camera surveillance is the use of computers to interpret the data. The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device. Software Description: The Storage and Network Calculator software can calculate the saving time and required disk space for the recorded video files, and the bandwidth for transferring the video streams.</p>

Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
<p>Homeowners knew that so long as their loyal and faithful watchdog was monitoring their home's security, they were safe, and so were their families and possessions. Some people may say that we should not have surveillance cameras in public places.
