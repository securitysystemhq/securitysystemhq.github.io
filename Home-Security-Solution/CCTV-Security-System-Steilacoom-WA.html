<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make. The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>

This is as simple as it sounds, wired burglar alarm systems mean that all the connecting component parts need to be wired together to complete the electrical circuit. The security systems run from $500,000 per district for an analog system consisting of CCTV (closed circuit television) monitors to million-dollar IP-based systems with digital surveillance cameras connected to a web network.</p>
<p>More recently, decentralized IP cameras , perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation. It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms. This includes access to the ADT Pulse smartphone app, which is available for iOS and Android This doesn't work with smart home voice systems like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, though.</p>
