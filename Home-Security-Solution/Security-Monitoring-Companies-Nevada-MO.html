The most effective systems are those which are monitored by trained staff, have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress, and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>In the majority of successful systems, sensors need to be distributed to all areas of the building in order to detect fires in even the most remote corners. The sound activated burglar alarm circuit was constructed in accordance with the circuit designed as illustrated Figure 4. The design was simulated on electronics work bench 11. The testing followed the modular pattern used in the design with each functional block being tested as described as follows.</p>
<p>Thus, the burglar alarm sound installed in a system should be loud and distinguishable enough for everyone in the premise to hear. There is a sensor or a group of sensors placed along strategic and vulnerable areas in the house such as doors and windows.
