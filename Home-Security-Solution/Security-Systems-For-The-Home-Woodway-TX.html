Sound the siren on your Ring Alarm from anywhere inside your home and dispatch emergency services with professional monitoring.</p>

The ADT Pulse monitoring service starts at $28.99 per month and requires a three-year contract, but you also have to figure in the cost of things like hardware components, cellular backup, and installation.</p>
