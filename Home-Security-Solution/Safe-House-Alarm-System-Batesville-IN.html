<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire.

The remaining structure of the article is organized as the Section 2 deals with the basic requirements for designing of video surveillance system including different types of cameras and video management systems using surveillance display.</p>
<p>In the majority of successful systems, sensors need to be distributed to all areas of the building in order to detect fires in even the most remote corners.

The testing followed the modular pattern used in the design with each functional block being tested as described as follows.</p>
<p>All these things working in unison and correctly have often saved the lives of people who were in buildings that have caught fire. Upon receiving an alarm notification, the fire alarm control panel must now tell someone that an emergency is underway.
