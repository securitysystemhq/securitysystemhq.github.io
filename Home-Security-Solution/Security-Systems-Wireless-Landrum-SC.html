Manage cameras and recordings with Digital Video Recorders that provide great compression technology and an easy-to-use user interface. Each intruder alarm system is one of the vertices (red marks) of the correspondent rectangle which is associated to one of the security areas.</p>

On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>
