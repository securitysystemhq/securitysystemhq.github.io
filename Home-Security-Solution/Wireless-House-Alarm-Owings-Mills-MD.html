In a protective alarm system, means for creating two light beams extending across an area to be protected, means for converting said beams into electrical energy, means for chopping said beams in such a manner that the output of said converting means is constant and will vary in voltage when one of said beams is modified by an intruder in said area and indicating means responsive to said varying electrical energy.</p>
<p>These cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. This isn't the cheapest package Protect America offers, but we think it provides solid home security that's still affordable. Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>
