Adiline Macriga, Smart Home Monitoring and Controlling System Using Android Phone, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Website: (ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 11, November 2013).</p>
<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems. Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away.

Videos from both IP cameras and analog cameras can be transferred over the computer network whereas unlike analog cameras, IP cameras can connect directly to an IP network.</p>
<p>When these perimeter sensors and interior motion detectors are part of a stand-alone system, the siren and flashing lights are the only deterrents for discouraging the intruder and thwarting the break-in. ADT offers pet-immune motion detectors, wireless components for easy integration into your home, and two-way voice capabilities. Cameras that are set on potential entry points that have DVR capabilities are a great way to help law enforcement personnel identify burglars and vandals.</p>
