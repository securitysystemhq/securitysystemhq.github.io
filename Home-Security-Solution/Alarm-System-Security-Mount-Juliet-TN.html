<p>Outdoor Security Cameras - never miss a beat with weatherproof security cameras. Axis EN and MxPro 5 fire panels from global systems leader, Advanced, have been certified by FM Approvals to the EN 54 standard, becoming the first UK-manufactured fire alarm control panels to attain this accreditation. Unless you have a UPS or power backup the cameras and recorder will also be powered off if there is no electricity.</p>

<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
