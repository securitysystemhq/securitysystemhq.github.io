<p>Serving over one million customers, Brinks Home Security bridges the gap between do-it-yourself smart home security and traditional professionally monitored systems. Using clever sensors, it can distinguish between cars, pets, foxes and people, helping to reduce unwanted alerts and unnecessary use of the super-bright security floodlight. That integration enables you to use your voice to turn the camera on and off, capture a quick recording, or put it into privacy mode, as well as to call up a live view on a TV with Chromecast or Fire TV. Logitech says the Circle 2 will support HomeKit Secure Video, an end-to-end encrypted storage system using iCloud, later this year.</p>
<p>Ionisation alarms are best suited for detecting fast-flaming fires that don't give off much visible smoke. For instance, you can draw areas of active motion sensitivity within the camera's field of view to limit the number of alerts that arrive on your phone, and some of these cameras have object recognition and can tell the difference between a person and an animal, or a car. If you have the extra bandwidth on your network, the higher quality video and easier setup of NVR is likely the best choice.</p>
