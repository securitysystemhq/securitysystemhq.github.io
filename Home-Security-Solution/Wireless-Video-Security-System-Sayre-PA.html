You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
