<p>Many cities, businesses, and individuals have installed Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras for surveillance purposes. The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>

We deal in IP CCTV, CCTV Cameras installations, Biometric systems, Fire Detection Systems which are easy to operate, highly sensitive and offer high performance. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance.</p>
<p>Security definitions can be adapted to each intruder alarm control system, for an individual security policy. Under this range, we comprises Burglar Alarm System and Intrusion Alarm System. With a CCTV camera, you loose image quality every time you transfer the video from the analog signal when it is digitized in the cameras Digital Signal Processor, which is then converted back to analog to run up the coax cable, which is again digitized at the DVR for recording.</p>

<p>They can also be speaker strobes which sound an alarm, followed by a voice evacuation message which warns people inside the building not to use the elevators Fire alarm sounders can be set to certain frequencies and different tones including low, medium and high, depending on the country and manufacturer of the device. Or if you want to save the trouble of recharging, a solar panel comes as a handy solution for many battery CCTV camera types to get non-stop power.</p>
<p>This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

The benefits of having a security camera are numerous whether it is used for home security or for business.</p>

The aim of fire alarm systems is to warn people of an emergency. Each of these cameras is equipped with different functions and features and is used for specific purposes. To fine tune even further the motion sensing capability, the surveillance cameras can be programmed to deaden parts of the sensor field so that small animals or little kids playing won't trigger the devices.</p>
<p>It should be noted that when fire-alarm systems are properly installed and maintained, they perform very well. If a burglar opens the window, the system is activated in exactly the same way as the door switch.
