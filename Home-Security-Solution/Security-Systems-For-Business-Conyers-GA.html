Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors , and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations.
