<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>The cameras perform different functions depending on the type of surveillance system being used. They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it.
