<p>There are two types of cameras used for surveillance - analog and IP (internet protocol), which are digital cameras.

Currently, Ring Alarm and the professional monitoring service are available only within the U.S. (excluding American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada (excluding Quebec). Video surveillance cameras have two main types of connections: wired or wireless. Burglar alarm circuits are constructed in a similar manner, other than the fact that instead on flipping a switch, the alarm's circuits are completed when it detects an intrusion like a breaking of a window, or opening a door, when it is activated.</p>

Although it can't record continuous motion (without a subscription) and often leaves gaps of a few seconds in between video clips—making it less desirable as a security camera—it is otherwise the best battery-powered unit we tested.</p>
<p>And if a component of a DIY system fails, the homeowner is responsible for repairing or replacing it. With a traditional system, the home security company will typically replace faulty equipment for free, or for a minimal charge.
