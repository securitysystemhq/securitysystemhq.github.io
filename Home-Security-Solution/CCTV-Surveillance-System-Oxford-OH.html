<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>Also, many of these systems can integrate with other smart-home devices, such as thermostats, locks, and light bulbs.
