<p>Panasonic, leading the global security industry for 60 years, will continue to provide world-top-class innovative intelligent AI security solutions supported by Panasonic unique video capturing x sensing” technology for a safer tomorrow. Stability for the Ultra Series NVRs is ensured by using RAID and N+1 hot spare, ensuring smooth and reliable video streaming and recording. All installed components, including sensors, are linked to a control panel. A few years ago, you'd need to budget thousands in order to create a video monitoring, web-connected, home security system, but today you can install a few affordable wireless sensors, a connected motion-sensing camera and enjoy 24-7 home monitoring, with alerts sent direct to your phone from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system. For a fairly modest outlay, this security camera delivers a reliable performance - provided you use the Ethernet cable, because Wi-Fi connectivity can be flaky - and a good set of features. These detectors are preset to sound an alarm when the air temperature exceeds the fixed temperature. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>
