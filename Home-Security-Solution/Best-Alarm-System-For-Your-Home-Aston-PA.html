<p>Home security is big business both for security and alarm companies and of course the bad guys. In phase-I that is targeted for this year, South Western Railway (SWR) has recently commissioned Video Surveillance system (CCTV) at 6 major stations - Ballari by providing 33 Cameras, Belagavi with 36 Cameras, Vasco-Da Gama with 36 Cameras, Bengaluru Cantt with 21 Cameras, Bangarpet with 36 Cameras, Hassan with 36 Camera and at 3 Stations at Hassan, Shivamogga Town & Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam, work is under progress and will be commissioned shortly.</p>
<p>Today there's a lot more to a home security camera than video surveillance. In a remote monitoring approach, combined with Risk Based Monitoring , you are moving away from 100% SDV onsite. I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>
<p>In short, NVR records higher-quality video and allows for systems to be scaled up much more easily than can be done with DVR. Link Interactive offers a wide variety of panels, sensors, remotes, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, cameras, smart home hubs and smart locks, thermostats and lights - everything you need for intrusion detection, surveillance, environmental monitoring and home automation with the freedom to build your own system from the ground up.</p>

All of the products will be usable with or without the live monitoring service, which costs $20 per month (or $23 with unlimited video storage).</p>
<p>The object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric burglar detecting system which is operated by any degree of interception of the light beam carrier thereby preventing defeat of the system by an intruder. Link Interactive's equipment is pretty standard, but it carries more types of security devices than anyone else we've seen. Burglar alarm system troubleshooting is performed by proficient professionals although home owners are also able to do uncomplicated troubleshooting in the company of their respective burglar alarm system.</p>

In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars.

A:In order to find out if someone tried to break into your house or it was a false alarm, you would need to check if the alarm was triggered because of incorrect key codes, if you ran into the house without disarming the system, or your pet moved into the sight of a motion detector.</p>
