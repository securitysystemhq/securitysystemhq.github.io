An example of this is infrared motion detectors (sometimes called PIR motion sensors, or passive infrared sensors). After the control panel receives a signal for an initiating device and goes into an alarm state, the panel initiates output devices that signal to building occupants that there is an emergency situation.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras have, and will provide a solution to many crimes. This can be accomplished wirelessly and you can even use you mobile phone as the monitoring device to let you view what is happening in your home at any given time. We also offer alarm monitoring from our remote Alarm Receiving Centre, where our security team are standing by to respond in person to any alarms which have been triggered. It also monitors their operational integrity and provides for automatic control of equipment and transmission of information necessary to prepare the facility for fire, based on a predetermined sequence.</p>
