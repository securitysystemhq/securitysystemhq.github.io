A basic intruder alarm system consists of a control panel, with rechargeable battery power backup and internal or external keypads, several interior and perimeter intrusion detectors, and one external sounder, at least.</p>
<p>You would use 30fps only for quick motion applications like license plate capture cameras or for cameras overlooking a cash register.
