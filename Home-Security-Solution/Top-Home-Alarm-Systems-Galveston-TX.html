<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR.

<p>For this reason, more and more households and businesses are being equipped with security cameras with the hopes of protecting their properties. Kisi is designed to work with the two most used burglar alarm system styles: an integrated alarm system, and a pin code alarm system.
