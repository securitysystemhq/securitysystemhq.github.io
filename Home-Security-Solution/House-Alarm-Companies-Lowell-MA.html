<p>Hidden cameras and spy cameras are becoming increasingly popular for use in home security. Major players in the home security system market are ADT (US), Honeywell (US), Johnson Controls (US), HANGZHOU HIKVISION DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY (China), ASSA ABLOY (Sweden), SECOM (Japan), Robert Bosch (Germany), United Technologies (US), Godrej & Boyce (India), (US), Allegion (Republic of Ireland), Control4 (US), Schneider Electric (France), Legrand (France), ABB (Switzerland), Comcast (US), STANLEY Convergent Security Solutions (US), Nortek Security & Control (US), FRONTPOINT (US), and Vivint (US).</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time.
