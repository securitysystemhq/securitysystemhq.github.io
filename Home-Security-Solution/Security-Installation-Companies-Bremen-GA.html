<p>CCTV security cameras have come a long way since being first introduced into the market in the late 1960's. We deal in a wide assortment of products including video surveillance systems, time attendance system, finger print based time attendance system, card based time and attendance system, biometric (finger print) door lock, CCTV camera system, IR camera, night vision camera, networking multi-doors controller, box camera, PTZ dome camera, dome camera, heat detectors, PIR sensor, long distance inductive guard tour system and guard tour system for non-security personnel.</p>
<p>Many residents and businesses are now utilizing surveillance cameras and these cameras may capture persons and events without the owner's knowledge and this captured information may help the police department solve crimes and help keep the Borough safe. The Smonet outdoor security camera is equipped with night vision, wide-angle lens and 720p HD video quality. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small.</p>
<p>All countries with a population of at least 250,000 are using some form of AI surveillance systems to monitor their citizens, says Steven Feldstein from the US think tank Carnegie And it is China that dominates this market - accounting for 45% of the sector's global revenue. Modern healthcare systems are undergoing a paradigm shift from in-hospital care to in-home monitoring, leveraging the emerging technologies in the area of bio-sensing, wireless communication, mobile computing, and artificial intelligence.</p>

Enjoy easy Plug-n-play into your wireless router to download the app for total protection. You cannot use cameras alone for home security. The systems are designed to detect and analyse incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions.</p>
<p>If the fire alarm system is addressable, the source of the occurrence will be pointed on the control panel. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Today, due to different technological advancements, video surveillance cameras are better than ever and can now be used with computers for more complex situations.</p>

Fire detection systems are designed to discover fires early in their development when time will still be available for the safe evacuation of occupants. Ultra Series Cameras capture ultra-high quality and high definition videos. This is the main reason that airports and other transport sites have beefed up security by installing such smart video surveillance techniques as digital video cameras.</p>
