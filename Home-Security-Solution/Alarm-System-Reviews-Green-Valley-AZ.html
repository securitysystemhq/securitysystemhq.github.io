<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Disadvantage: high rate of false alarm or no alarms at all for systems using light that leaks out of the optical fiber. When a sensor or alarm is tripped on a DIY system , you'll receive a notification on your phone. For indoor locations as shown in Table 1 , a camera that provides a very wide angle of view is needed so as reduce the requirement of the no of cameras and to reduce the dark spots. A category L2 system designed for the protection of life and which has automatic detectors installed in escape routes, rooms adjoining escape routes and high hazard rooms.</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Wireless burglar alarms work similarly to wired ones, but the sensors communicate with the control panel via a radio frequency. Learn more about professional home security monitoring here.</p>

<p>But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.

<h3>Home Security - Protect Your Home with Dummy Security Cameras in Green Valley</h3>
<p>8. Flexible And Cost Effective Infrastructure Choices: With CCTV cameras, you have expensive coax cable, fiber, and unreliable wireless installations. Some security cameras have been designed to be small that they can be concealed in everyday objects such as toys and household appliances. They'll record video when the doorbell is pressed or when motion is detected, and usually offer two-way audio communication that allows you to speak with the visitor from anywhere via your phone.</p>
<p>Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>

We've tried out a number of smart home-security systems to see how easy they are to set up and use, and asked a security expert to assess how likely they are to deter an intruder.
