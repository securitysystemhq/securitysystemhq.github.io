<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off. Without the cable keeping lights, alarms, and sprinkler systems operating, tragedies are going to happen. This feature allows you to disable the interior motion sensors but leaves the perimeter sensors active for the best in home security. DVRs generally offer what is known as D1 resolution, which is the traditional video quality used in closed-circuit television systems.</p>

On the contrary, some security camera providers offer cloud storage monthly plans to securely store videos on the cloud. Alert systems can also close fire doors, recall elevators, and interface and monitor the installed suppression systems, such as sprinklers.</p>

You will also want all the basic security equipment as well, such as a control panel, window and door sensors, motion detectors, environmental protection sensors to protect your home from intruders or potential disasters such as a fire or pipe break, etc. The purpose of an automatic fire-alarm system is to detect an occurrence, alert the control panel and proper authorities, and notify the occupants to take action.</p>
