<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted. Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>
<p>However, it has no self-monitoring option: If you cancel, you lose monitoring, remote access, and all smartphone alerts, though the sensors and sirens will still work, so you can at least set an alarm when you're home at night. When magnetic sensor will detect the movements in the door or window, it would send signals to the control box which would in turn send a signal to the alarm device, such as a bell.</p>
