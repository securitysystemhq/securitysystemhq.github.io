Smart phones can also now be used to remotely set and unset alarms via apps. These cameras also use a variety of techniques such as Tilt-Zoom, Low Light, Infrared No-Light and License Plate technologies. Wireless: The burglar systems are operated without using any cables or chords which mean the subscriber can sacrifice those wires which take him hours for installation.</p>
