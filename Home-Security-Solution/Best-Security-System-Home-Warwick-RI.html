Conversely, advanced digital cameras are those that are not connected by a circuit but can be located at any site around the world. Most fire alarms provide information about where the fire is located to emergency responders. Outdoor cameras are one of the best ways to deter (and catch) burglars, vandals, and other miscreants.</p>

Potential uses include locations where reliable water supplies do not exist, where even sprinkler water discharges are too high, or where building construction and aesthetics impact the use of standard sprinkler pipe dimensions. The appropriate areas for proper placement of cameras can be entrances, hallways, driveways, T- Points, highway intersection points, exits, etc., and in areas where there is a high density of people or vehicles.</p>
