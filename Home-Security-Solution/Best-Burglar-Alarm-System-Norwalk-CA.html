<p>With the continual increase in theft, burglary and vandalism, crime is something everyone thinks about. Bottom Line: The Abode iota is an easy-to-install all-in-one security system loaded with features including a 1080p camera, a motion sensor, multiple wireless radios, a built-in siren, and support for many third-party devices and platforms. When alarms go on and lights go out, people start pushing and shoving in order to escape the building. Drains should be properly installed to remove all water from the sprinkler system, and prevent water from leakage onto protected spaces, when piping service is necessary.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>Unlike competitors that focus purely on security, Abode Iota also serves as a smart home controller. Those who prefer to get hold of the wired versions may need to put in considerable amount of work as the installation of these wired security systems entail wiring positioning and drilling of holes. Expect to pay more for a security camera with features like rugged outdoor housing and crisp night time vision.</p>
