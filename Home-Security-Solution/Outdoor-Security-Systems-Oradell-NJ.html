From video collection only, to multi-dimensional data awareness: A Huawei Software Defined Camera (SDC) — with a full hardware series available, designed for diverse scenarios — converges cloud IoT data with media and information networks, to realize 360° awareness of people, vehicles, objects, the environment, and behaviors, mining multi-dimensional data for true value, and promising to comprehensively safeguard cities.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety. In fact, I can't recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire. In the event of an intrusion or life safety event, the alarm siren on the ADT Security Hub will be activated and an alert will be sent to your smartphone but ADT will not be notified.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly detect motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.

These video cameras can be used to help monitor the safety of elderly, babies, or the children with their nanny.
