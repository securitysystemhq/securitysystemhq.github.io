<p>The Base Station also has a USB port for storing recordings on an external hard drive, a nice supplement to the free cloud storage, and it's more secure than systems that record to a microSD card in the camera itself: Because the storage is tucked away safely indoors, if someone steals your camera, they won't get your video, too.
