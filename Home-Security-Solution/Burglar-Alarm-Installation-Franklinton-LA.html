IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do. What this means to the consumers is a sharper, crisper, and more detailed picture than what is achieved with analog. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>Home security systems often require long contracts and pro installation, but there are smart systems you can install yourself that include a monitoring plan to keep tabs on it—and only when you want that. With real-time temperature measurement technology, bullet series hardware ensures safety in waste removal centers, recycling centers, and anywhere rapid temperature changes are critical. Simply install a door or window alarm and rest easy, knowing that your home environment is protected.</p>
