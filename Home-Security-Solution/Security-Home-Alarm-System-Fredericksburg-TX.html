<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself. But there are also several drawbacks when you opt to use a smoke alarm instead of the fire alarm panel. The rising awareness regarding the benefits of CCTV cameras in commercial sector is also increasing the demand for CCTV cameras. You can easily add additional sensors, and removing the system when you move house is a lot less tricky than for wired versions.</p>
