<p>IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it.

You may see the reputable security companies offering free home security systems, but these usually include a contract and a monthly monitoring fee.</p>
<p>Some wireless security systems use a hardwired control panel that needs to be connected to your home's electrical system—ADT's Pulse® systems are a good example.
