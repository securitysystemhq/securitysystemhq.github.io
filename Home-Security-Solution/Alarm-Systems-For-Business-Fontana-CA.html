Link Interactive offers a wide variety of panels, sensors, remotes, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, cameras, smart home hubs and smart locks, thermostats and lights - everything you need for intrusion detection, surveillance, environmental monitoring and home automation with the freedom to build your own system from the ground up.</p>
