Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>
<p>If you really want to record the scene going on in the premises then you need to take the help of DVR (digital video recorder) systems. From this approach the "intelligence" capability of all the distributed net will be applied to react in a much more efficient way to the different alarm situations that can occur, being the alarm systems able to distinguish more accurately real security violations from, for example, unadvertedly operations, increasing security levels and also the immunity to technical failures.</p>
<p>Network cameras are ideal for both domestic and commercial purposes because you can see what's going on whilst away from the property. Digital cameras are also available in "smart" models that are equipped with motion detection software that captures any movement that is untimely or is unusual.
