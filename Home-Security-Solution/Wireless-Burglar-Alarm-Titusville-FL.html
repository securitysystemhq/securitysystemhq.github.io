Solving Cases - Number 3 brings us here; if the cameras do not work as a crime deterrent, then the footage video surveillance systems capture can be used as evidence and help ensure that the proper arrests and prosecutions are made in case of a theft, vandalism or assault. The National Electrical Code covers the equipment and wiring of fire alarm systems. While wireless cameras are considerably cheaper, it's important to keep in mind that they are also more vulnerable.</p>
<p>Disadvantage: high rate of false alarm or no alarms at all for systems using light that leaks out of the optical fiber. When a sensor or alarm is tripped on a DIY system , you'll receive a notification on your phone.

Several cities feed video surveillance into monitoring headquarters, often referred to as domain awareness centers” or real-time crime centers.” Some hope to expand the footage they collect through their own surveillance cameras by also tapping into footage taken by private individuals and businesses. Wired cameras are hard wired to the security system, meaning you need to physically string power and data cables from a central hub or recording device to each individual camera.</p>
<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again. And by recording a wide 180-degree view whenever its motion sensor or mic are triggered, the DCS-2530L does its job quite well.</p>

You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
