<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>When it comes to a closed-circuit, no energy means alarms sound immediately. This uses the latest innovations in video compression technology to provide high resolution video quality from the smallest amount of video data required. Fire alarm systems typically consist of several inter-linked components, such as smoke detectors, heat detector, carbon monoxide, manual call points, sounders, alarm and buzzer. Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>An IP camera transmits a digital signal using Internet Protocol over a network. Burglar alarm circuits can be of two kinds - open and closed circuit systems. We start with solutions from the leading burglar alarm system manufacturers, then apply our expertise to the challenge of integrating the best burglar alarms, wireless systems options, and remote management tools. Wireless alarms are battery-powered. To reduce false alarms this type of detector is usually combined with a passive infrared detector, or Dual Tec brand or similar alarm.</p>

<p>These security cameras are a deterrent to all the violent outburst and fights that might occur. Several cities feed video surveillance into monitoring headquarters, often referred to as domain awareness centers” or real-time crime centers.” Some hope to expand the footage they collect through their own surveillance cameras by also tapping into footage taken by private individuals and businesses.

<p>CCTV cameras, the abbreviation of closed-circuit television cameras, are applied in wide range for different purposes. Properly deployed, a fire alarm system reduces the probability of injury or loss of life and limits damage due to fire, smoke, heat and other factors.

This would include a wide set of options such as sirens, sensors, magnetic switches, ultrasonic detectors, microwave detectors and security cameras.</p>
<p>Whilst IP CCTV has been available for around 10 years, it is only in the last few years that the technology has matured, leading to the developments in Megapixel and High Definition (HD) technology. Again, when using video surveillance systems, the idea may be to let people know that they are being watched in order to keep them in line. With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone.</p>
<p>Illustration of the wireless remote monitoring technology for cardiovascular implantable electronic devices. The most basic systems are typically geared towards home security, alarm monitoring and basic lighting. If only a single tube is used, the alarm relay is placed in the plate circuit of the vacuum tube and the potentials are so adjusted that the plate current is high when the light is falling on the cell, and the grid voltage only slightly negative or even positive.</p>
<p>Video surveillance protects employees indirectly by monitoring each visitor who comes into the building and keeps a video record of suspicious activity. With a network camera you have an established IP address, giving you clear digital pictures with no loss of quality. Many in the CCTV industry claim that many analog cameras can outperform network cameras at a lower price. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space.</p>

<p>These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible. The motion detectors for indoors are suitable for stores, offices, public facilities and residential buildings, in addition to manufacturing, machine shops and garages, for example. Disadvantages: expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost), and a high rate of false alarms as it cannot distinguish some pets from humans.</p>
