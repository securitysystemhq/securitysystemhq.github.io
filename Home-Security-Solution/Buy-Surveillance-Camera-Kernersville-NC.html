<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Stream your home cameras through your phone, arm your alarm system, and control all of your home devices from the same app. Abode also offers a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensor and one motion detector.

<p>Advanced motion sensors include reliance on photo-sensory detection (say, a burglar walking into a beam of light from a light sensor source and breaks the path of the beam to trigger the alarm).

<h3>Security Camera - Surveillance Camera Systems For Home And Office in Kernersville NC 27284</h3>
<p>There are two types of cameras used for surveillance - analog and IP (internet protocol), which are digital cameras.

<p>Whenever there is an unauthorized entry into the house, the system identifies it and alerts by the production of a loud alarm. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. The detector identifies any smoke or heat in the building or if someone uses the manual breakpoint. It is sometimes the case where an alarm panel or wiring is attacked by an intruder and oftentimes the equipment is damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p>New inventions in this field such as digital video cameras make it possible for businesses to study customer traffic and monitor any site for security without human intervention.
