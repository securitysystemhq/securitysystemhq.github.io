Cameras should be mounted as close possible to the field of view required, and the closer the camera to the subject the better the identification of the subject will be.

<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it.

However, two types of CCTV cameras - analog CCTV camera, and IP CCTV camera record the sound in different manners: 1. … It means, between the DVR and the microphone (audio input device), it is the analog signal transmission.</p>

There are a few other questions you might want to consider before you select your burglar alarm system.

<p>Good quality cameras will produce quality images and the reverse will apply as well. A traditional wired system will need to be installed by a professional, and often requires some drilling (and holes in your walls) to connect the sensors to the main alarm system.
