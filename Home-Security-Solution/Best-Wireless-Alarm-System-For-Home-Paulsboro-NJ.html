<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>Like any product that connects to the internet and uses wireless technology, smart home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, particularly systems that lack encryption. This helps eliminate false alarms and unnecessary responses. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel. We present a broad assortment of CCTV Cameras including Motion Activated Solar Light DVR that records both video as well as audio whenever activated by even a slightest motion.</p>

<p>Today's video surveillance systems aren't just about security cameras. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Homeowners who have installed burglar alarm systems statistically stand a better chance of avoiding invasion than those without protection. First of all, they are not truly wireless, as the majority of wireless cameras still require a power cord to be run to a power socket.</p>
