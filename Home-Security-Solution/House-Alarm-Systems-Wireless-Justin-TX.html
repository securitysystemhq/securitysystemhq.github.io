<p>Of the many types of burglar alarm, one of the biggest defining factors for a system is whether the alarm is wired or wireless. This means when your alarm is activated and your monitoring company gets the signal, they will try to call the location to cancel the alarm. Finally, output devices exist which shut down equipment such as HVAC systems to prevent the spread of smoke, activate automatic suppression systems including pre-action sprinkler systems and more.</p>
<p>The company focuses on improving core technologies of audio and video encoding, video image processing, and audio and video data storage, as well as forward-looking technologies such as cloud computing, Big Data, and deep learning. Video surveillance systems can add next-level security to your company's efforts to deter crime. Professionally installed systems may also have remote dialing where a phone call is made usually to a central monitoring station when someone breaks in, before the audible alarm sounds.</p>

Reviewers found that the Nest Secure system was easy to install, with the small sensors easily fitting into corners in hallways and on door frames.

In hardwired intruder alarm systems each protected zone is a closed loop circuit, where a fixed current flows.</p>
