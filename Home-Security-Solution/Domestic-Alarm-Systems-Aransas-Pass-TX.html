<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Most DIY systems are easy to install and are sold as kits that you can configure to suit your specific needs. Pro Series Doorbells provide video intercom functionality, supporting communication with the master station and the indoor station. The mobile and IP communications have developed and completely changed the way we now use, monitor and control intruder security systems. After a certain number of false alarms, the police won't respond to any call-outs.</p>
<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely. They are great for those in rented accommodation as they can be removed just as easily as they were installed so when you move on to your new home, you can take the alarm system with you. Fire alarms reduce property loss: While strobe lights and sirens don't actively put out fires, they alert the people who can.</p>

<p>With the advent of modern technology you now have smarter and affordable home security systems that you can set up all by yourself. If the building is also provided with an automatic sprinkler system, the water flow devices and valve tamper switches are also connected to the fire alarm system.
