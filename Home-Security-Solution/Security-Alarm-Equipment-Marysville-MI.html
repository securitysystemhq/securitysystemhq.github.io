Be cautious of signing a long term contract with a newly established monitoring company, especially if they want you to pay the entire monitoring bill up front. Security cameras can be used not only to monitor the inside of a building but to survey the outside areas like car parks and perimeter fences.</p>
<p>Multiple Users viewing: Multiple users could watch the live video from the same camera at the same time, clearly and smoothly. Most of the video surveillance systems installed in the US are for home and business security applications.
