It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>You may have to do some systems troubleshooting especially when there are many false alarms. When an existing Customer moves away from the protected home or business and another Person or Company moves in, it will be simple for the Alarm Company to change the system parameters to suit the new Customer.
