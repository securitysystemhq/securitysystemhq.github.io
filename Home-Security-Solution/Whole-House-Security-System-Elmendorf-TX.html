<h2>Home Security System Companies Elmendorf Texas</h2>
<p>Our solutions offer flexible integration with existing systems including video, access control, and other systems. There's a lot of talk about wireless cameras, but that term can be confusing. An example of this is infrared motion detectors (sometimes called PIR motion sensors, or passive infrared sensors). After the control panel receives a signal for an initiating device and goes into an alarm state, the panel initiates output devices that signal to building occupants that there is an emergency situation.</p>
<p>The internet protocol (IP) based structure of the new surveillance systems takes into consideration versatility, adaptability, and digital security. Our video software integrates easily with your existing hardware, legacy systems and the rest of your network environment.
