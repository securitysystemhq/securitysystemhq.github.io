<p>Large buildings require a central control panel to show staff and the fire brigade the location of a fire within the building if a fire is detected. Sprinkler systems look bad and will harm the building's appearance. Not all surveillance cameras are static. This box camera includes a 6-60 mm variable focal auto-iris lens which gives security installers a lot of flexibility to adjust the camera angle of view and zoom level. Also to provide high resolution and high quality videos, we have storage like DVRs, NVRs and many other solutions. When hiring an alarm or home security company, check to see if your state requires them to be licensed.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety.
