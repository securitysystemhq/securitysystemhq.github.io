<p>If an intruder breaks in a house through a door or window, his movements will be detected by a switch which will trigger the burglar alarm. This CCTV camera has a 2-way noise-canceling microphone and speaker equipped with the device. However, in our next type of System, which is an Intelligent Fire Alarm system, each detector effectively incorporates its own computer which evaluates the environment around it and communicates to the Control Panel whether there is a fire, fault or the detector head needs cleaning.</p>
<p>When you are selecting your burglar alarm system, you will have to decide what kind of sensors you want.
