<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>All these sensors work in tandem with other sensors and the IP camera so that the central control device sends warnings and notifications to your smartphones. The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm. In one, New York City police in a helicopter supposedly monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared video camera on an amorous couple enjoying the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop balcony.</p>

<p>Remotely viewing your home security cameras provides you with the ability to always know what is happening at your home, so that you can have peace of mind that everything is ok. Remotely viewing cameras from a PC is becoming a more common feature of home security camera systems. This is primarily due to the fact that there's such a great multitude and wide variety of house security and alarm systems and security companies in the market.</p>
<p>Security cameras have multiple benefits that go beyond seeing what's behind the lens.

<p>The IP based CCTV cameras will bolster the growth of global CCTV camera market over the period 2015-2025. Nothing beats the performance and dependability of video surveillance cameras at compiling demographic data of malls, resorts, amusement parks, and tourist attractions. Another reliable way of sourcing a home security alarm monitoring company is to speak to friends and relatives who already subscribe to a monitoring service.</p>
<p>In this instance, we're talking about home security systems, which are networks of integrated electronic devices working together with a central control panel to protect against burglars and other potential home intruders. Mounted in places such as driveways, parking lots, parking garages, and car alarm stores, video surveillance cameras are valuable in protecting one's investment. Smoke and fire detectors that aren't wired directly into your alarm system cannot summon emergency personnel.</p>

CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
