<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown â€” only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>

This study develops a remote monitoring diagnostic framework to detect underlying heart conditions in real-time which helps avoiding potential heart diseases and rehabilitation of the patients recovering from cardiac diseases.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
<p>For this reason, most fire alarm systems are designed with one or more manual alarm activation devices to be used by the person who discovers a fire.

PIR motion detectors are set so that the control box will not sound the alarm immediately they detect body heat.</p>
<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
