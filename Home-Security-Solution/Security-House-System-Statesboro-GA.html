<p>A) Closed-circuit systems - In this system as long as your door is closed the electric circuit remains closed and whenever somebody opens the door, the circuit becomes discontinuous, and the alarm is set off.

<p>IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it.
