The HD cameras can be set with a very specific monitoring zone, so there's no need for traditional two-piece door or window sensors. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.</p>

If your building offers security, you might not need your own video surveillance system. Security cameras are a great start to securing your home.
