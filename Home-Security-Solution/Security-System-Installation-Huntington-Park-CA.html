<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>
<p>The amount and quality of data stored on storage media is subject to compression ratios, images stored per second, image size and is effected by the retention period of the videos or images.
