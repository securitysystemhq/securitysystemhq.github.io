<p>In order for a company to provide live monitoring, they must charge a monthly fee, since they will either be connecting your service to the company's central system through a landline phone or through cellular technology.

As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
