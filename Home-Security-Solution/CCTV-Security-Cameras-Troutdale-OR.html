<p>Fire alarm system always promotes efficient security with perfect protection from fire hazards by using ring led indicator fire alarm and smoke detectors. Customer can view the live feed from door stations and any connected cameras while storing messages and captured images. Protect your property with a variety of intruder alarms, surveillance equipment, sensors and controlled entry systems. Leveraging on our quality oriented professionals, we are offering Wired Fire Alarm Control Panel to our clients. Digital CCTV cameras range from compact cameras, fixed cameras to direction-controlled ones that can distinguish objects in the dark under different lighting conditions.</p>

When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system. For a fairly modest outlay, this security camera delivers a reliable performance - provided you use the Ethernet cable, because Wi-Fi connectivity can be flaky - and a good set of features. These detectors are preset to sound an alarm when the air temperature exceeds the fixed temperature. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>
