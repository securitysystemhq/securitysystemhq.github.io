<p>One of the most important lessons preschool children must be taught is fire prevention and safety. This may include motion-sensing devices that alert you when it detects motion. In addition, the marriage of MNS and fire alarm control systems is a growing trend that it is hoped will continue and be applied in larger varieties of facilities and multibuilding properties, including schools, high-rise buildings, mass transit hubs, and even public gathering places such as theatres, restaurants, and places of worship.</p>

Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with long and typically onerous contracts, and often rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. Meraki's pedigree in networking security means MV is built to be secure from the ground up. By default, data is encrypted through every step.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale are DIY-installed systems costing as little as £200.

This CCTV camera has a 2-way noise-canceling microphone and speaker equipped with the device. However, in our next type of System, which is an Intelligent Fire Alarm system, each detector effectively incorporates its own computer which evaluates the environment around it and communicates to the Control Panel whether there is a fire, fault or the detector head needs cleaning.</p>
