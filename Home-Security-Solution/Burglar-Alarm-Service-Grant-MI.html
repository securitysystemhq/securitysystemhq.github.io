<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. In these systems, the monitor to be viewed will often be automatically shifted to a larger screen and will activate recording equipment.</p>

<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
