Based on all fire code criteria and the building worksheet it is determined that additional information is necessary to conclude with certainty that removal of any portion or all of the fire alarm system will not adversely affect either the compliance of the building or the function of other life safety systems in the building.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that, based on the proposed intelligent smoke alarm system, the air condition can be more accurately distinguished, and the probability of false alarms is greatly reduced, so that the air information can be viewed in real time and the alarm information can be received in a timely manner. The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system.</p>
