<p>CCTV camera security systems are the popular equipments used for security purposes now days. That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>Now you can get Frontpoint's high-end DIY security systems without getting stuck in a contract for three years. An alert's processing time can depend on the home security system setup, the technologies used at the monitoring center, the quality of staff training and more. Like a lot of other standard IP cameras, Smart iCam provide visual motion detection feature. IP cameras also have additional features that analog cameras don't offer, such as video analytics, which allow for mobile notifications and automatic recording if there is movement within the camera's field of vision.</p>

<p>Hidden cameras are becoming more of a compulsory for ATM machines and banks as they help in catching fraudulent people red handed. Even given their life safety nature fire alarm systems are starting to utilize IP-based functionality and should be integrated with other systems within a smart building. Compared to burglar alarms some years back, home security systems today are highly advanced and a lot of sophisticated.</p>
<p>The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS). The camera is equipped with a 130-degree field of view lens, 1080p HDR and a 4K sensor and digital zoom-in up to 12x for crisp, clear camera footage.

If you choose not to add another monthly fee to the mix, you may be disappointed with what the Nest Cam Outdoor can (and can't) do.
