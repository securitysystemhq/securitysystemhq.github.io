All of the systems in this article are installed by professionals, which are good for those who don't have the time, patience, or expertise to install all the requisite sensors and equipment. Indoor alarm systems will allow monitoring within the house. In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void.

<p>You can't power your CCTV camera over your Ethernet network, and this is beneficial because you don't need a power outlet to power a network camera. Past statistics on crimes show that the more noticeable and better technology the camera systems are, the more it helps in preventing criminal activities in business or residential buildings 6 Factors that are necessary for an outdoor camera are: they should be weather- resistant, and should include night vision even in well-lit locations.</p>

Disadvantages: expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost), and a high rate of false alarms as it cannot distinguish some pets from humans.</p>
<p>When running the cable it is good practice to leave couple of loops of extra cable at both camera and monitoring locations. In most situations, fires are controlled with approximately 10-25% of the water normally associated with sprinklers.
