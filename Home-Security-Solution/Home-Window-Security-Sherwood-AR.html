<p>Digital cameras: IP cameras are higher resolution, which generates clearer images but, as we said, use more bandwidth to transmit and require more storage space. As such, they provide added opportunity for emergency personnel to respond and control the developing fire before severe damage occurs. IDC has published an article on how TCS helped Triveni Turbines to provide market differentiating customer service using remote monitoring solution.</p>
<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>

ADT offers pet-immune motion detectors, wireless components for easy integration into your home, and two-way voice capabilities. Cameras that are set on potential entry points that have DVR capabilities are a great way to help law enforcement personnel identify burglars and vandals.</p>
