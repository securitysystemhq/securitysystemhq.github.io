<p>Fire alarms are important security devices which help to seek protection against fire accidents. If you have an Xfinity X1 cable TV box, you can control the system from there and watch live video from the camera. We specialize in providing an extensive range of CCTV cameras, and performing research and development in Camera DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for other renowned manufacturers. You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. Smoke detectors connected to your smart home hub are able to alert your phone, so you know when there's an emergency even when you aren't home.</p>
<p>Stream your home cameras through your phone, arm your alarm system, and control all of your home devices from the same app. Abode also offers a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensor and one motion detector. They usually work on two principles: heat detection and smoke detection. By linking them with police control room, on the event of robbery or theft, the alarm will self-operate and send a message to the nearby PCR vans.</p>

<h2>Home Security System Installation Valparaiso Indiana</h2>
<p>Most wireless security cameras operate by using a separate camera and receiving unit. When the output value is repeated several times for the set alarm value, that is, when the fire generates smoke, the alarm is pushed. As shown in Figure 7 , the intelligent smoke alarm system consists of a smoke detection module, wireless communication module, and intelligent identification and data visualization module. Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>
<p>The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS). The camera is equipped with a 130-degree field of view lens, 1080p HDR and a 4K sensor and digital zoom-in up to 12x for crisp, clear camera footage. For the homeowner who likes to attempt DIY then a wireless burglar alarm is an ideal solution. Even public places like parks, shopping malls and restaurants need surveillance cameras.</p>
