Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>

<p>4. The primitive CCTV systems was not applied in security monitoring until 1968 when New York was first to install video cameras in an effort to fight crime.

The cameras were all configured accordingly and put through their paces one by one to test all functionally of the camera as well as image quality.</p>
<p>You can't power your CCTV camera over your Ethernet network, and this is beneficial because you don't need a power outlet to power a network camera. Past statistics on crimes show that the more noticeable and better technology the camera systems are, the more it helps in preventing criminal activities in business or residential buildings 6 Factors that are necessary for an outdoor camera are: they should be weather- resistant, and should include night vision even in well-lit locations.</p>
<p>Almost all of the Pro Series PTZ Cameras are equipped with "powered-by-DarkFighter" technology, making low-light monitoring an easy task. In this paper, simulation and experimental investigation on the early aspirated smoke detection system is carried out to analyze the response performance of fire detectors located at the smoke sampling pipes. In a closed circuit system, when a door or window is shut, the electric circuit is closed.</p>
