<p>CCTV security cameras have come a long way since being first introduced into the market in the late 1960's. We deal in a wide assortment of products including video surveillance systems, time attendance system, finger print based time attendance system, card based time and attendance system, biometric (finger print) door lock, CCTV camera system, IR camera, night vision camera, networking multi-doors controller, box camera, PTZ dome camera, dome camera, heat detectors, PIR sensor, long distance inductive guard tour system and guard tour system for non-security personnel.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring and control (M&C) systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as factories, power plants, network operations centers, airports, and spacecraft, with some degree of automation. That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. Professionally installed systems take the trouble out of things for homeowners who don't have the time or expertise to set up all the sensors and accessories themselves.</p>

Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
