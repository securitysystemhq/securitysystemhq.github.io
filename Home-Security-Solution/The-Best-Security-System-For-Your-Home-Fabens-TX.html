<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>Bullet Cameras: Bullet security cameras are a type video surveillance camera that are typically small and shaped like a rifle bullet shell or lipstick case. Monitoring employees using employee video surveillance can be a high risk, high reward situation for an employer.

A woman, who appears to be a security guard, is allowed to leave as the police enter the library.</p>
<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time. The city has since adopted a new partnership with General Electric in which street lights are equipped with cameras and microphones. In a large public building additional fire safety features will be required - such as ceiling sprinkler systems and elaborate communications devices - that are not required on private properties.</p>
