The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm.

Cloud based storage is another option, which means you don't need to deal with equipment; the video is uploaded directly to the cloud.</p>
<p>And the software also provides other functions, like wiper control, editing password, restoring default settings, and batch upgrading. Directly attached storage are the hard drives that are located outside of the digital video recorder, network video recorder or server.
