Up to 32 control panels and parallel indicator panels - can be linked redundantly to a ring network. Hikvision's PanoVu Series cameras are perfectly designed for this purpose.</p>

Video surveillance systems involve strategic placement of security cameras, monitoring motion and activity, generating alerts, transmitting footage, and storing that footage.

However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>
<p>The cost of your home security system can vary based on the price of equipment, alarm monitoring, installation and more. Box cameras present an obvious sign for anyone who passes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime.
