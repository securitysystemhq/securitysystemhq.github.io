Most of our surveillance systems include DVR viewer software for Mac and Windows PCs, as well as camera viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android mobile devices.</p>
<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>

Heat detectors usually have built-in thermistors to sense the heat.
