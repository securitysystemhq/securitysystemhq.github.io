<p>Surveillance cameras on the corner of a building. 5. In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two protective light beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses and shaped to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photoelectric means and means responsive to the varying voltage for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>CCTV Camera Pros has simple fixed lens models as well as high end varifocal cameras with sens-up, WDR, and on screen display controls. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."

<p>A wire-less system has components similar to a conventional wired-in do-it-yourself burglar alarm system, but the communication between the various parts is by radio waves rather than by electricity. Do it yourself home security systems may be a little confusing and difficult on the outset, but the moment you get the hang of things with instructional manuals and the right tools in hand, you'll certainly have your security alarms fixed in no time.</p>
<p>Outdoor surveillance cameras need power and light in the dark and a mounting place. We recommend the ADT PulseÂ® plan because it includes home automation technology and wireless equipment.
