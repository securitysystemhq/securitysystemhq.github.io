Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors.

<p>You can also ramp up your security level with more sophisticated add-ons such as a closed-circuit camera system for full monitoring inside your home and out.
