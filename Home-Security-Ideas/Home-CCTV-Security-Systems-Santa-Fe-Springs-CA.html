<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>We provide burglar alarms which utilize the most recent innovation to secure your belonging and can be customized to suit your particular needs. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets or security personnel on patrolling and physical surveillance. They come in wide variety of configurations, but generally how alarms work is with a network of motion detectors and door and window sensors integrated with a control panel.</p>
<p>Digital Video Recorders accepts only analog camera feeds as inputs and supports remote viewing over the Internet. So whether you choose a DIY home security system or opt for the traditional route, a home alarm system is a smart investment. Here's our 2018 video surveillance buyer's guide to help break down the component parts of video surveillance systems. Here's a list of just some of the home alarm systems providers Fort Knox® can upgrade & monitor: ADT, Honeywell, Xfinity, Ademco, DSC, Go Control, GE Security, AT&T Digital Life, First Alert, Interlogix, and Napco.</p>
