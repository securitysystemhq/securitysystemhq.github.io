<p>Panasonic, leading the global security industry for 60 years, will continue to provide world-top-class innovative intelligent AI security solutions supported by Panasonic unique video capturing x sensing” technology for a safer tomorrow. Stability for the Ultra Series NVRs is ensured by using RAID and N+1 hot spare, ensuring smooth and reliable video streaming and recording.

<p>Fire alarms shorten your recovery time: Less building damage means shorter downtime until you can reopen for business. Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. In some cases, people will mount signs in their front yards alerting potential intruders that surveillance cameras are in operation. These sensors are positioned strategically around a premises and can detect motion, and trigger the alarm countdown.</p>

<p>This allows the CCTV camera to increase the video image quality in low light conditions. Motion detection recording means only record when video camera detect movement, then it will start to record, no motion, then no record.
