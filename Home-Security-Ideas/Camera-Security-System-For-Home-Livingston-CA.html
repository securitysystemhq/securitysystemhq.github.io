<p>If you're only concerned with protection against home intruders, for instance, you don't need a home burglar alarm which will also let you notify the fire department incase of a home fire or emergency services for help following an accident or health emergency.

<p>Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
