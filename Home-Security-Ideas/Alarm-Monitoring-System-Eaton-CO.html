As stated earlier, there are basically three types of home security alarms: do-it-yourself (DIY) alarms, mid-level alarms and high-end ones. Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>

<h3>Hidden Security Cameras Vs Overt Surveillance Cameras in Eaton</h3>
<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard drive. In addition to giving you peace of mind, a monitored home security system can reduce the chance you'll be a victim of a burglary by 300 percent and could save you up to 20 percent on your homeowners insurance.</p>
<p>These cameras share the images across the internet, so CCTV footage can be easily accessed. If you are looking for a full proof security system to protect your house, you can use the combination of the motion detectors and open or closed circuit alarms. It's never an easy task to evacuate people from really large buildings, even with the latest in fire alarm design. If you are concerned that an audible deterrent is not merely enough security for your needs then monitored security systems provide added assurance and peace of mind that someone is monitoring your home 24 hours a day and should your alarm be triggered, help will be on its way.</p>

Keep sensors and motion detectors clean and dust-free as dirt build-up can cause them to trigger the alarm. The system allows you to effectively monitor multiple locations at the same time, and requires no manpower to capture the video.</p>
