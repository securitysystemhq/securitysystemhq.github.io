<p>Large buildings require a central control panel to show staff and the fire brigade the location of a fire within the building if a fire is detected. Sprinkler systems look bad and will harm the building's appearance. Not all surveillance cameras are static. This box camera includes a 6-60 mm variable focal auto-iris lens which gives security installers a lot of flexibility to adjust the camera angle of view and zoom level. Also to provide high resolution and high quality videos, we have storage like DVRs, NVRs and many other solutions. When hiring an alarm or home security company, check to see if your state requires them to be licensed.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home.

Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
<p>The best home security systems use tools and technology to help keep you, your family, and your property safe.
