<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

A woman, who appears to be a security guard, is allowed to leave as the police enter the library.</p>

<p>Not only does it provide very good value for money, but it also offers a level of customer service that no other company can match. No doubt, a video surveillance camera system does deter criminals. In many cases, they can do more than just tell them that there has been an alarm in the building; they can be directed by the kind of alarm and where the alarm is. Moreover, many modern systems now include speakers that provide alerts in place of (or in addition to) traditional bell-type alarms.</p>
