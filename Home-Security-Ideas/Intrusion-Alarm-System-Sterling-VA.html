<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>In addition, any attempt to force entry that is detected is forwarded to an alarm control panel, which then reliably sets off a loud alarm and the offender is forced to escape. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
<p>The next item in a home security monitoring system is evaluate is the receivers that contact police, fire, and emergency response. To use remote monitoring effectively, a risk assessment must be performed and included in the monitoring plan prior to the start of any clinical programme and adapted as the programme evolves. With Security packages, certified professionals monitor your home for alarms, smoke, carbon monoxide or water leaks to notify you and emergency services as needed.</p>
