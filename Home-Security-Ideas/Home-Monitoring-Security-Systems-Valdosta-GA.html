<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make. The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>
<p>If a detector recognizes a condition which could be indicative of a fire, the control panel will first attempt a quick reset.

The Digital Video Recorder also known as a DVR is used to take footage or video taken by a security camera and storing it as the name says, digitally, onto a hard drive. The camera uses a number of sensors to detect the presence of a person in the room and monitor their activities.</p>

<p>Surveillance plays a huge part in today's society, and with cameras all around us, our day-to-day lives are experiencing higher levels of security each day. Your job is not done, however, after you buy and install smoke detectors. It is during the testing of your alarm system you will see if any problems have occurred in relation to the burglar alarm battery.

IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
