Hikvision products also provide powerful business intelligence for end users, which can enable more efficient operations and greater commercial success. Two-stage fire alarm systems warn only certain people who are authorized to take appropriate action before the second stage.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time.

<p>All these capabilities make alarm systems more robust, not only in terms of security but also in terms of supervision flexibility. The British Security Industry Association (BSIA) estimates that, of the approximate eight million homes with alarms, 30% are audible-only alarms - alarms that ring or have a siren but are not monitored - and just 2% are remotely monitored alarms.
