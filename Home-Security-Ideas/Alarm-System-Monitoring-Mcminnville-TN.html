<p>Help secure your home with a smart security camera and motion sensors. In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras connected—either hardwired or wireless— to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. However, it is important to ensure the reliability and safe operation of fire-fighting equipment and installed systems such as fire alarms and emergency lighting.</p>
<p>The DVR then processes the image data and saves it as a video recording on its hard drive. Click here to get help with the ADT Security Hub or ADT Professional Monitoring Services.
