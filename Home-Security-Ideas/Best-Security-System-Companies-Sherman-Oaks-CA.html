Some devices can only be controlled by a remote control whilst others can be controlled in multiple ways: a physical switch on the device itself, a remote control, and a smartphone or any web-enabled device.</p>
<p>Security alarms are a helpful deterrent to ward off potential intruders but, although these clever bits of kits may be helping to fend off con artists, they can be known to be ‘trigger happy' over what constitutes a break-in. Many alarms panels are available with touch panels or touchpad screens. Many security systems can be controlled remotely by more than one user. The motion detectors used are like those in the alarm systems.</p>
