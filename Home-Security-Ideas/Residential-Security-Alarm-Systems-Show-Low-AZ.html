<p>One of the most important decisions you will have to make for your office is what type of fire alarm system you choose to have installed. I dont see how these CCTV cameras will stop terrorism. Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>Ask the home security company for an itemized breakdown of all charges, which may include equipment costs, installation fees, monthly monitoring charges and more. The Digital Video Recorder also known as a DVR is used to take footage or video taken by a security camera and storing it as the name says, digitally, onto a hard drive. The camera uses a number of sensors to detect the presence of a person in the room and monitor their activities.</p>

Some DIY systems are self-monitored, which means you'll receive alerts when devices are triggered, but it's up to you to contact the local authorities if there's a break-in or a fire. Video surveillance security cameras protect your employees both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. In rural applications, where reliable sprinkler water supplies can be expensive, mist systems may be comparable or less than standard sprinklers.</p>

Photosensitivity of the camera is measured in units called LUX higher number, the higher the amount of light needed to capture images.</p>
