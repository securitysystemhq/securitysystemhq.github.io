<p>The Base Station also has a USB port for storing recordings on an external hard drive, a nice supplement to the free cloud storage, and it's more secure than systems that record to a microSD card in the camera itself: Because the storage is tucked away safely indoors, if someone steals your camera, they won't get your video, too. If you want more peace of mind that a problem at your home will be dealt with quickly, you could consider a burglar alarm with a monitoring contract - 38% of the people we spoke pay for one of these.</p>
<p>Motion sensing cameras can send an alert to your security company or your smartphone app when they are triggered, allowing you to get a feed just at the moment you need it, rather than all the time. A:Most companies do not give a lot of time when the alarm is first activated to when you personally disarm it. If you haven't disarmed it in this given time frame, the monitoring center would receive your information in about 10 seconds or as specified by your home security company.</p>
<p>You can buy additional components individually to extend your protection, or purchase one of the larger Alarm Security Kit bundles. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%).
