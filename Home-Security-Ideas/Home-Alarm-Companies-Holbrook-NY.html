<p>When choosing a video surveillance system, you want to go with the best video quality for the buck, and with a Network IP camera, there are 10 reasons why you should consider them over 20th century CCTV cameras. However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan. Dome cameras are typically used for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The central module connects at the Internet via WiFi and through an application we can remotely monitor the state of the house or control various devices within the enclosure. Abode's small scale makes it easy to forgo professional monitoring, especially if your main goal is to stay connected to what's happening at home instead of deterring intruders.</p>
<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off. Without the cable keeping lights, alarms, and sprinkler systems operating, tragedies are going to happen. This feature allows you to disable the interior motion sensors but leaves the perimeter sensors active for the best in home security. DVRs generally offer what is known as D1 resolution, which is the traditional video quality used in closed-circuit television systems.</p>
<p>Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189).

<p>It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered.
