<p>Recently, we put some of the latest in HD IP PTZ cameras to the test in low light conditions to see which model is the superior when it comes to outdoor video surveillance in this environment The 3 cameras that were put to the test in low light conditions are the Axis Q6045-Mk11, Pelco D220, and the Hikvision Darkfighter DS-2df82233I-AEl. Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
<p>These cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. This isn't the cheapest package Protect America offers, but we think it provides solid home security that's still affordable. Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>
