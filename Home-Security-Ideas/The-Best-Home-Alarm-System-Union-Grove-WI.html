This CCTV camera has a 2-way noise-canceling microphone and speaker equipped with the device. However, in our next type of System, which is an Intelligent Fire Alarm system, each detector effectively incorporates its own computer which evaluates the environment around it and communicates to the Control Panel whether there is a fire, fault or the detector head needs cleaning.</p>

CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes.
