<p>Initially, fire alarm systems are designed to detect any element associated with fires. Modern line detectors are very stable and false alarms caused by animal motion, rain, fog or snow have been eliminated. Conspicuously placed cameras have been proven to reduce threats of violence and vandalism at businesses dramatically. It uses Z-Wave enabled devices to make it easy for you to automate lights, locks, thermostats, and more—no matter which level of monitoring you select. The first signal sent by your control panel will alert monitoring personnel at the central station, who will call to notify you and confirm whether it's a real emergency or a false trigger.</p>
<p>Also, many of these systems can integrate with other smart-home devices, such as thermostats, locks, and light bulbs. With support for over 2,500 security camera models and related encoders-plus virtualization, centralization, and integration with the most popular access control systems-our video surveillance solutions provide a wide range of benefits to meet your organization's video security demands. Apart from homes and business premises, security cameras have many other applications; they can be used in different places to monitor and prevent criminal activities.</p>

Fire prevention: Preventing break-ins is only one part of a security setup; most systems also offer protection against fire and carbon monoxide, although those devices cost extra. A CCTV unit will need to be installed by a professional, but if you own a very large property then the cost is definitely worth it. They can be placed both externally and internally and the DVR playback is easy and straightforward.</p>
<p>Brinks Home Security, one of the established names in the industry, recently received a facelift after MONI Smart Security purchased the name rights to the company and gave the company a serious overhaul. There is a delay of several seconds which allows the homeowner time to enter the property and key in the security code to turn the system off. To extend the backup time only plug the DVR and camera power supply to the backup unit and the monitor to regular power strip, this way if we do loose power for some time the DVR and cameras are still functioning as normal while monitor is off.</p>
