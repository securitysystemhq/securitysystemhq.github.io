<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time.

<p>Today's video surveillance systems aren't just about security cameras. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure.
