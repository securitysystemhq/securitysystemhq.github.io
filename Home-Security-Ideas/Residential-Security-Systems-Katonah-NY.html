<p>On the minus side is the inconvenience of activating and deactivating the alarm, and the cost and problems with false alarms. Good Wi-Fi coverage is essential, and most systems will have a range of around 20-50metres, but if you have black spots around the house the system may struggle. Manual fire alarms are used to alert an entire building in the event of a fire.
