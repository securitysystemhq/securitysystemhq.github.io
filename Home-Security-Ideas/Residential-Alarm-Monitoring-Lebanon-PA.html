<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>They provide a very low false alarm rate, and have a very high chance of detecting real burglars. Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is usually a simple process, and it is often possible to bring all of your existing devices and sensors to the new wireless system. Alarms are also provided to alert building management when a sprinkler valve is closed. Mission effectiveness of a fire alarm safety system is based on four factors: Design, equipment, installation, and maintenance.</p>
<p>The least expensive is the wired camera and it can be wired through a security DVR to your computer or to your router and the Internet. A key aspect of fire protection is to identify a developing fire emergency in a timely manner, and to alert the building's occupants and fire emergency organizations.

<p>Monitoreal video security assistant uses advanced object detection so you can see the things you want (people, vehicles, animals) and ignore the things you don't. In addition to perimeter sensors, many systems also include motion detectors that monitor large areas inside the house. These surveillance systems may not always catch these crimes because they usually occur in more deserted places and far from the surveillance cameras' reach.</p>
<p>The object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric burglar detecting system which is operated by any degree of interception of the light beam carrier thereby preventing defeat of the system by an intruder.

For professional or public infrastructure security applications, IP video is restricted to within a private network or VPN 120 IP cameras are considered part of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) and have many of the same benefits and disadvantages as other IP-enabled devices. Some come with the programs that indicate date and time (timers), so actually if one is monitoring what time the intruder got in, the record from the home security monitors can show this in precision.</p>
<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>
<p>The detection devices detect the presence of smoke or particles of combustion and then alert the FACP about a problem; the FACP then decides what action to take.

<p>If properly utilized, remote monitoring services can act as useful IT management tools at a fraction of the maintenance cost.
