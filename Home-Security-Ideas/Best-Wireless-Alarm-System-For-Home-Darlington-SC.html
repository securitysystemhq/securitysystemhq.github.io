In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two protective light beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses and shaped to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photoelectric means and means responsive to the varying voltage for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>This poses a challenge for alarming in public buildings which are visited by many different members of society.

<p>Home security systems that are 100% DIY let you pick the security products, set them up, and monitor them—all on your own. The camera transmits a signal to the receiving unit that can store the video signal in a proprietary DVR unit or in some cases directly onto a computer hard drive.

If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
