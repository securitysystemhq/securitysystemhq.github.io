Pro Series DVRs support HD videos, H.265 Pro+ and H.265 encoding technology, 4K resolution output, power over coax (PoC), multiple VCA events, and more. A non-monitored burglar alarm system operates on a ‘bells only' basis - in other words, when triggered, its only function is sounding an alarm to alert neighbours and hopefully scare off the intruder.</p>
