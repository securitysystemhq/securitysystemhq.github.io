<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.

Video surveillance systems can add next-level security to your company's efforts to deter crime. Professionally installed systems may also have remote dialing where a phone call is made usually to a central monitoring station when someone breaks in, before the audible alarm sounds.</p>
