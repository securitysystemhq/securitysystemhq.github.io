<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>Some of the most popular uses for hidden surveillance cameras are to guard one's home or personal belongings.

<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control. SimpliSafe cameras work as standalone devices. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. Home monitoring sensors have a number of applications in your overall home security.</p>
<h2>Automated Home Security  Benton Arkansas</h2>
<p>When the detector has been compensated to its limit, the control panel alerts maintenance personnel so that servicing can be performed. You will also want all the basic security equipment as well, such as a control panel, window and door sensors, motion detectors, environmental protection sensors to protect your home from intruders or potential disasters such as a fire or pipe break, etc. The purpose of an automatic fire-alarm system is to detect an occurrence, alert the control panel and proper authorities, and notify the occupants to take action.</p>
<p>Fire protection systems are complex safety systems, which must be absolutely reliable in case of emergency. The fire alarm panel activates the flashers or the sounders, turns on sprinklers (or they can be activated along with the detector), or makes a call to the authorities or to the occupants. Intelligent addressable smoke detectors are compatible with MAXLOGIC series addressable panels.

<p>Of the many types of burglar alarm, one of the biggest defining factors for a system is whether the alarm is wired or wireless. This means when your alarm is activated and your monitoring company gets the signal, they will try to call the location to cancel the alarm. Finally, output devices exist which shut down equipment such as HVAC systems to prevent the spread of smoke, activate automatic suppression systems including pre-action sprinkler systems and more.</p>

<p>The various fire alarms need to be placed all around throughout the building in order to protect every remote corner. With the introduction of increasingly sophisticated technology, today's alarm systems have the ability to provide more information to the fire department and first responders.

<p>Service Providers can give their customer, the homeowner, the power to monitor and control many devices in the home: Thermostats, door locks, lighting, cameras - while at home or away. Intelligent intrusion detection is a delicate balance between responding to real security breaches and ignoring costly false alarm sources. A properly selected sprinkler will detect the fire's heat, initiate alarm, and begin suppression within moments after flames appear.</p>
<p>Network cameras can be used for very cheap surveillance solutions (requiring one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV installations (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs , and CCTV monitors become computers with TFT screens and specialised software. In my view it is the best security system with low cost of ownership.
