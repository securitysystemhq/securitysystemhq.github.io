DVRs can save CCTV data for up to 10 weeks of recording time and there are even some which has motion detection technology. Southwark shows how CCTV cameras - that fully adhere to the UK code of conduct - are used to help catch criminals and keep people safe. Surveillance cameras aren't just for crime prevention anymore, unless you are advertising the fact that the property has surveillance camera's installed to deter would be criminals.</p>

From this approach the "intelligence" capability of all the distributed net will be applied to react in a much more efficient way to the different alarm situations that can occur, being the alarm systems able to distinguish more accurately real security violations from, for example, unadvertedly operations, increasing security levels and also the immunity to technical failures.</p>
