<p>Most office buildings, school, hospitals and homes today have fire alarm systems installed. Once you've installed your system, simply connect the DVR to your internet router or modem and you can view your cameras anywhere in the world at no additional charge. A bespoke intruder alarm system, supplied and maintained by ClearView, will deter and detect potential intruders to your site. This type of alarms is best at detecting fires which are smoky and smouldering.

A CCTV unit will need to be installed by a professional, but if you own a very large property then the cost is definitely worth it. They can be placed both externally and internally and the DVR playback is easy and straightforward.</p>
<p>Homeowners knew that so long as their loyal and faithful watchdog was monitoring their home's security, they were safe, and so were their families and possessions.

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
