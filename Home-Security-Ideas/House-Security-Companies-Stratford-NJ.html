<p>Prior to fire alarms, smoke detectors were primarily the main indicator for alerting the occupants of a building to a fire. Without a plan, you'll still get a quality camera with a great viewing angle. It is best if you use a local company because they are often more in-tune with what is happening in your specific area and some even offer discount fees to local residents taking up their monitoring service. DVRs come in 4, 8, 9, and 16 channel increments and this selection is critical because adding cameras above the DVR channels available will require an additional DVR, not just additional channels.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>Apart from being an effective deterrent, surveillance cameras can also provide image evidence that can be aid in post-crime investigations and prosecution. After installation, we offer full training, maintenance, and support to keep your video surveillance systems operating effectively.

<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>
