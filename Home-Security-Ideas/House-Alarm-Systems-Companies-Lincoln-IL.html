<p>Wireless alarms look nicer but are more expensive. Footage is also often recorded at a lower resolution than wired cameras, making it more difficult to identify people in recordings. It also offered a pledge of commitment to security and released a fleet of updated equipment to settle customer worries and instill greater confidence in their services.
