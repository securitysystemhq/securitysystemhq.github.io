In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The burglar when shorts loop wires together hides the End-of-line-resistor from the control panel, letting the control panel know that something is going on.

Walter Bruch , a noted German engineer, designed and installed the system that used CCTV cameras to observe the launch of V2 rockets on monitors. Prior to the integration of wearable sensors into the system, calibration of the wearable sensors has been done with respective conventional measuring devices, used in hospitals.</p>
<p>Statistically, approximately 61% of all sprinkler controlled fires are stopped by two or less sprinklers. This is the safest and simplest intention of a security alarm system.

<p>Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council, says: Fire-alarm systems and smoke alarms are life-safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>Burglar alarms are equipped with smart technology to pick any unrecognized entrance or infiltration. I also probably want a few "covert" cameras, placed where not even my employees know they are, and which do not show up on the public, or even the back-office, monitor.

Video surveillance security systems are likely to hold the largest share of the home security product market by 2018.</p>
