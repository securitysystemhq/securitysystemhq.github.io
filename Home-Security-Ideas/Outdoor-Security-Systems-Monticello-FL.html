In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The burglar when shorts loop wires together hides the End-of-line-resistor from the control panel, letting the control panel know that something is going on.

Prior to the integration of wearable sensors into the system, calibration of the wearable sensors has been done with respective conventional measuring devices, used in hospitals.</p>
<p>Statistically, approximately 61% of all sprinkler controlled fires are stopped by two or less sprinklers. This is the safest and simplest intention of a security alarm system.

<p>Burglar alarms are equipped with smart technology to pick any unrecognized entrance or infiltration. I also probably want a few "covert" cameras, placed where not even my employees know they are, and which do not show up on the public, or even the back-office, monitor.
