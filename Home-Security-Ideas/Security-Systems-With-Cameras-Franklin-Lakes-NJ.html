<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
<p>That competition has nudged third-party operators to step up their technology to the point where their technology and training can stack up against just about any in-house monitoring service. Manufacturers offer different types of cameras like fixed camera, bullet camera, dome camera, infrared camera, wireless security camera, spy camera and more.

You can also connect the dome camera to your PC via the usb cable to view all the recorded videos. In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. While there are some legitimate uses (nanny cams,” employee monitoring, and so on), the low cost and the ease of use means that the capability to perform surveillance by amateurs is a very real and a danger to almost anyone.</p>

<p>According to the Metropolitan Police, a massive 92% of all alarm activations in the UK in recent years have been false alarms. Heat detectors act like the previous two but will only send an alarm signal if it detects an extreme rise in temperature. T. Gowthami, G. Adiline Macriga, Smart Home Monitoring and Controlling System Using Android Phone, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Website: (ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 11, November 2013).</p>
<p>Some door alarms have an additional 'visitor' setting which gives a chime or bleep when the door is opened. You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>The fire alarm system must communicate with and control its system components and it must also communicate with offsite facilities and organizations such as the fire department and emergency services. Program Arduino to sense the data from all the three sensors and send these data to raspberry pi through serial communication. Smart Cloud Cameras from ambicam are a hassle-free option for your outdoor and indoor security needs.</p>
