It's disappointing that the Yi Outdoor Camera doesn't have the people alerts that are on the company's indoor camera, since those could really cut down on notifications of bugs and car lights.</p>
<p>All these capabilities make alarm systems more robust, not only in terms of security but also in terms of supervision flexibility.
