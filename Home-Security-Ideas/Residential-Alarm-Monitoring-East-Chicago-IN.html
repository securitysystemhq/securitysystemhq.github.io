Modern burglar alarm systems are in great demand, as they've proven to be a very good way to protect your home and belongings. Being necessary to certain applications and environments to have a redundancy systems strategy, the topology of the distributed network ("grid") can implement this functionality with efficiency, because with all intruder alarm systems connected we can simply choose those for the same security and surveillance area.</p>
