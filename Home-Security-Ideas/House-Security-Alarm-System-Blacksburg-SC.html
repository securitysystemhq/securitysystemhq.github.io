Along with high resolution images, Matrix IP cameras decrease storage costs by offering latest H.265 Compression technology. Finally, experts state that a home without an alarm system is three times more likely to be burglarized than a home with a professionally monitored system installed. With the latest smart home technology from your favourite security brands, deterring burglars and detecting trespassers has never been easier.</p>
