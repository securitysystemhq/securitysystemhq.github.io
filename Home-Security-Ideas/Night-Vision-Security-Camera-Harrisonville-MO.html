With the built-in GPS & Bluetooth module and the internal HD camera, the PVR provides multiple functionalities, such as positioning, picture capturing, video and audio recording, a walkie-talkie function and more. Like indoor security cameras, they can be integrated as part of a home security system or used individually to up the security level around your home.</p>
<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs.
