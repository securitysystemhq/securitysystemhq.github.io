With the built-in GPS & Bluetooth module and the internal HD camera, the PVR provides multiple functionalities, such as positioning, picture capturing, video and audio recording, a walkie-talkie function and more. Like indoor security cameras, they can be integrated as part of a home security system or used individually to up the security level around your home.</p>
<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. In these systems, the monitor to be viewed will often be automatically shifted to a larger screen and will activate recording equipment.</p>
