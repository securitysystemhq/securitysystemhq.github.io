<p>While outdoor cameras are really useful devices, have you ever wondered how they work? Provide cellular connectivity and management support, making them ideal for use in remote patient monitoring, clinical trials or for health visitors and social workers. For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, causing more than 100 of the cameras to go dark. Panic alarms receive police response based on fear of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally receive fire response based on an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad.
