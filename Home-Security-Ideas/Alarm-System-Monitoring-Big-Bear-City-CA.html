<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Vivint wireless security camera systems can be outfitted with motion sensor technology that is both energy-efficient and more secure. Presently, sophisticated burglar alarm ranging from miniature, self-contained noisemakers, to intricate, multi-zoned systems having color-coded computer monitor outputs are available. They receive a signal from a fire sensor (smoke, heat or carbon monoxide detector) and automatically transmit it to the fire alarm panel.</p>
<p>Higher resolution cameras typically cost about $50 to $300 more than lower resolution versions. Our remote monitoring is not restricted to cardiac arrhythmia management.
