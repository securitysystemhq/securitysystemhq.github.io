Analog security systems - the recorded images or footage is sent to the DVR recorder (Digital Video Recorder) using a coaxial cable.

<p>This solves the problem of difficult installation of traditional smoke alarms and enables people to view the status of the alarm remotely, so as to ensure the timeliness of the alarm. These are most commonly seen in offices and other businesses, but can work effectively as a home security surveillance system as well.

Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
