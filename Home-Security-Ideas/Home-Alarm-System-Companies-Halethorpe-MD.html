The Mac software for iDVR-PRO surveillance DVRs is the best that we have tested. Shopping for CCTV Cameras had never been so easy in the past.</p>
<p>Because the DVR you choose will be recording the images your security system captures, it's as important a part of the total system as the cameras themselves. CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes. Forecasting and Post-Event Investigations: The usefulness of surveillance technology in preventing and solving crimes depends on the resources put into it. The most effective systems are those which are monitored by trained staff, have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress, and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities.</p>

It's never an easy task to evacuate people from really large buildings, even with the latest in fire alarm design. If you are concerned that an audible deterrent is not merely enough security for your needs then monitored security systems provide added assurance and peace of mind that someone is monitoring your home 24 hours a day and should your alarm be triggered, help will be on its way.</p>
<p>Among the sales arguments advanced for the burglar alarm, one of the strongest was that maintenance costs for the system were extremely low. Retail establishments use video surveillance to monitor what customers do. For example, if a client claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, video surveillance records are used to determine whether she was in the store on the day in question, and if she did purchase the item.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring - Many DIY home security providers don't offer professional monitoring to watch over your home at all times. The most popular fixed temperature detectors used in homes are preset to sound an alarm when the temperature exceeds 135 degrees F. Other units are available to be preset up to temperatures of approximately 200 to 225 degrees F. These detectors may be used in an attic where summer temperatures normally may reach 135 degrees F.</p>
