We will set the burglar alarm wires, which I have neglected for some time, as I fancied everything would be secure here. So, if you have a big budget, spring for a few Megapixel Cameras, for all of the other cameras focus on 540TVL and above resolution CCTV analog cameras.

<p>If the fire alarm system is addressable, the source of the occurrence will be pointed on the control panel. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
