<p>Because the DVR you choose will be recording the images your security system captures, it's as important a part of the total system as the cameras themselves. CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes. Forecasting and Post-Event Investigations: The usefulness of surveillance technology in preventing and solving crimes depends on the resources put into it.

<p>Any potential intruders will see that you have an alarm system in place and are likely to move on to a more vulnerable property than yours. One-stage fire alarm systems warn everyone in the building that a sensor has been activated. Some devices can only be controlled by a remote control whilst others can be controlled in multiple ways: a physical switch on the device itself, a remote control, and a smartphone or any web-enabled device.</p>
<p>The technical specifics may be slightly different for each security provider, but the basics of alarm monitoring is similar in any home security system. HSI offer a range of Fibreglass poles for testing detectors at height designed to be used with the Enclosed Delivery System or Heat Testing equipment.

Whether you're interested in a camera to deter thieves or a way to make sure packages don't walk off the porch , there are a number of cameras designed to meet your outdoor security needs.
