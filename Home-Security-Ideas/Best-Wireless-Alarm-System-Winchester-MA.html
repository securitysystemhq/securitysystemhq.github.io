<h2>Wireless Home Security  Winchester Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Our solutions offer flexible integration with existing systems including video, access control, and other systems. There's a lot of talk about wireless cameras, but that term can be confusing. An example of this is infrared motion detectors (sometimes called PIR motion sensors, or passive infrared sensors).

This involves a burglar alarm sound that is inaudible to the prowler but distinguishable to the occupant and a police station nearby. The presence of security cameras can serve as a deterrent to would-be thieves, while hidden cameras can protect discretely.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
