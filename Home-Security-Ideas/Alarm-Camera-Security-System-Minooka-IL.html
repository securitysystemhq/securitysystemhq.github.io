<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>But when the door or window is opened by an intruder, the circuit will be open, thus the alarm will be triggered. A video surveillance camera can be used for other types of tests on cars. Hikvision products also provide powerful business intelligence for end users, which can enable more efficient operations and greater commercial success. Two-stage fire alarm systems warn only certain people who are authorized to take appropriate action before the second stage.</p>
<p>A monitoring company will get in touch with the emergency contact for the address, check on the situation, and in emergencies, contact the police or fire department. A hidden camera surveillance system is great for the nooks and crannies of your business where covert actions may take place. We propose an application called Door Security System which is based on Android using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the status of the door, controlling the door and increasing security in a house.</p>

<p>A security company will make more money if you opt for a professionally installed system. Mid-level home security alarms are professional models that are not necessarily monitored by the police, but they are a lot more reliable than DIYs. When you have a home security system professionally monitored, and advertise this by displaying window stickers and yard signs, you're letting burglars know the likelihood they'll fail and be caught are very high.</p>
