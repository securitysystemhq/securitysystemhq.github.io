<p>Serving over one million customers, Brinks Home Security bridges the gap between do-it-yourself smart home security and traditional professionally monitored systems. Using clever sensors, it can distinguish between cars, pets, foxes and people, helping to reduce unwanted alerts and unnecessary use of the super-bright security floodlight.
