Finally, experts state that a home without an alarm system is three times more likely to be burglarized than a home with a professionally monitored system installed.

With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
