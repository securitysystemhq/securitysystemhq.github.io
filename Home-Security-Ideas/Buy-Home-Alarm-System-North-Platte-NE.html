<p>Practically all buildings and a lot of homes these days have fire alarm systems. You need to purchase a base station in addition to the camera, which makes the up-front cost more hefty than other cameras. Devices that come with the SimpliSafe system include the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensor and HD video quality, and a keychain remote used to arm or disarm the system. Your alarm-monitoring company may offer discounts. Video surveillance has become an integral part of businesses and law enforcement agencies that use these cameras extensively.</p>

<p>Complete, high-quality audio systems to improve security, make live or scheduled announcements, or create ambience with great-sounding background music. If you have large pets, you might want to consider skipping the motion sensors and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't triggered by movement but are triggered when a window or door is opened. Excessive demand has decreased the rates of these CCTV Cameras.</p>

<p>The Base Station also has a USB port for storing recordings on an external hard drive, a nice supplement to the free cloud storage, and it's more secure than systems that record to a microSD card in the camera itself: Because the storage is tucked away safely indoors, if someone steals your camera, they won't get your video, too.
