When a sensor or alarm is tripped on a DIY system , you'll receive a notification on your phone. For indoor locations as shown in Table 1 , a camera that provides a very wide angle of view is needed so as reduce the requirement of the no of cameras and to reduce the dark spots. A category L2 system designed for the protection of life and which has automatic detectors installed in escape routes, rooms adjoining escape routes and high hazard rooms.</p>
