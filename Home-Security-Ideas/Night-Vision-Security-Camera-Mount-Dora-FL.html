<p>Home security is big business both for security and alarm companies and of course the bad guys. In phase-I that is targeted for this year, South Western Railway (SWR) has recently commissioned Video Surveillance system (CCTV) at 6 major stations - Ballari by providing 33 Cameras, Belagavi with 36 Cameras, Vasco-Da Gama with 36 Cameras, Bengaluru Cantt with 21 Cameras, Bangarpet with 36 Cameras, Hassan with 36 Camera and at 3 Stations at Hassan, Shivamogga Town & Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam, work is under progress and will be commissioned shortly.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system. For a fairly modest outlay, this security camera delivers a reliable performance - provided you use the Ethernet cable, because Wi-Fi connectivity can be flaky - and a good set of features. These detectors are preset to sound an alarm when the air temperature exceeds the fixed temperature. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>

Sometimes they are referred to as lipstick cameras. With over 400 cameras installed across the City, video surveillance has become another critical and valuable resource for public safety. When the photosensitive elements receive enough optical signals, the electrode distortion is generated to trigger the alarm signal 26 But its shortcomings are also very obvious: water mist from kitchen, cooking fumes, and even the haze in winter are likely to trigger the smoke sensor, resulting in frequent false positives.</p>
<p>This is the foundation of any interactive monitoring home security system. CCTV is also known as Video Surveillance system. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating ‘Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy. In the last few years, the video surveillance market has seen a major transformation into third generation video surveillance systems, moving to IP video from traditional analog video causing better processing power and improved compression algorithm 3 These Intelligent video surveillance systems are not just confined to laboratories but have hit the marketplace as well.</p>
