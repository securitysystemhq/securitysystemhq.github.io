<h2>CCTV Home Security System Falfurrias Texas</h2>
<p>Help secure your home with a smart security camera and motion sensors. In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras connected—either hardwired or wireless— to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. However, it is important to ensure the reliability and safe operation of fire-fighting equipment and installed systems such as fire alarms and emergency lighting.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR. Video walls offer a very big screen so that many people can watch the captured videos from a number of cameras at the same time. This will give you the choice of watching the videos from these cameras live or at another time.</p>
