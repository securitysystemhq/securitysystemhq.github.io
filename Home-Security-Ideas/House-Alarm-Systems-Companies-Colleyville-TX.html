<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>The cameras perform different functions depending on the type of surveillance system being used. They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it.

Perhaps this is no better demonstrated than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had changed since he took on the role in 2014, with the growth of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more.</p>
