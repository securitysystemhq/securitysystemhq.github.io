<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>The burglar when shorts loop wires together hides the End-of-line-resistor from the control panel, letting the control panel know that something is going on. The EOL resistor value is usually provided by the alarm system manufacturer, typically 5.6Kâ„¦.
