<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks.

Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>

We deal in IP CCTV, CCTV Cameras installations, Biometric systems, Fire Detection Systems which are easy to operate, highly sensitive and offer high performance. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance.</p>

Basically, this allows your Nest Cam IQ device to shoot videos with multiple exposures, then digitally combine the images to create a more true-to-life video. To fully secure your business and the safety of your employees, you may want to also look at access control, monitored alarm systems and fire alarms.</p>

<p>Security cameras have multiple benefits that go beyond seeing what's behind the lens. Alarm monitoring is quick and detailed communication between your home security system and the central station of your security provider. Such alarms are resistant to animals and at the same time will get activated when you have an intruder. Privacy and hacking risks - Your DIY home security system will most likely connect to your home's router or Wi-Fi to monitor your home and send mobile alerts, but this also makes it easier for hackers to steal information if you're not careful.</p>
<p>As a result, a burglar alarm system for your flat will provide an extra layer of security to alert you in the event of an intruder. Bullet security cameras are a type of video surveillance camera that is typically small and shaped like a rifle bullet shell or a lipstick case.

The EU's Data Protection Directive regulates access to personal data including CCTV recordings.

To protect the purchaser and establish criteria for the manufacture and installation of residential fire detection systems, the National Fire Protection Association has developed NFPA No. 74, Standard for Household Fire Warning Equipment.</p>
<p>The threshold values on the basis of different age groups are presented in Table 2 The proposed alarming mechanism can be customized for individual monitoring due to the fact that the proposed alarming system accepts various threshold values, and values of the threshold levels can be defined on the basis of cardiac vital parameters of the individuals.
