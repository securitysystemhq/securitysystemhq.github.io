<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house.

A common misconception about our camera systems is that all cameras have to be the same resolution, which is not the case. At the same time a small CCTV camera is watching to capture and transmit back the details of your pin code number. The main purpose of the this fire safety equipment is to make the fire known so that people can immediately evacuate the location while those who are entrusted as fire wardens can carry out the necessary emergency procedures.</p>

Simplisafe continues to get louder, smarter, and more secure, upgrading their hardware and adding new products like the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro and SimpliSafe Smart Lock for your front door, supporting HD video monitoring and two-way chat plus remote locking and personalized PIN codes for convenient access.</p>
