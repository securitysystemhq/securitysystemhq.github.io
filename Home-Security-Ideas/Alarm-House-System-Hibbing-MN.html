<p>It is during this stage that early detection (either human or automatic), followed by a timely response by qualified fire emergency professionals, can control the fire before significant losses occur.

<p>Unlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security. When one unit senses smoke, all interconnected detectors will switch their relays; only the detector sensing smoke will go into alarm, thus pinpointing the fre source. Fire alarm cable is supposed to hold up under certain degrees of heat so that it continues to operate long enough to get people to safety.</p>
<p>DVR is a combination of software, hardware, and video storage. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.
