<p>Unlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security. When one unit senses smoke, all interconnected detectors will switch their relays; only the detector sensing smoke will go into alarm, thus pinpointing the fre source.

<p>DVR is a combination of software, hardware, and video storage.
