<p>If you're only concerned with protection against home intruders, for instance, you don't need a home burglar alarm which will also let you notify the fire department incase of a home fire or emergency services for help following an accident or health emergency. The advantage of conventional systems is that they are relatively simple for small to intermediate size buildings.

We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
