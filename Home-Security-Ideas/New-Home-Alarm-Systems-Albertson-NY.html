In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>Like any product that connects to the internet and uses wireless technology, smart home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, particularly systems that lack encryption. This helps eliminate false alarms and unnecessary responses. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel.
