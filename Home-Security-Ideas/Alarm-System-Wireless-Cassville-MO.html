<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>

They can be placed both externally and internally and the DVR playback is easy and straightforward.</p>
<p>I recently heard of a new home security company in New Mexico that is hiring ex police officers only to respond to alarm calls from members because quite frankly the response time from the police department was way to slow. However, two types of CCTV cameras - analog CCTV camera, and IP CCTV camera record the sound in different manners: 1. … It means, between the DVR and the microphone (audio input device), it is the analog signal transmission.</p>
