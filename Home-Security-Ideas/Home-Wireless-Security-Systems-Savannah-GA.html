In the event of an intrusion or life safety event, the alarm siren on the ADT Security Hub will be activated and an alert will be sent to your smartphone but ADT will not be notified.</p>

It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.

This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems. But the police say it must be as part of a suite of prevention measures because a burglar alarm on its own will not prevent entry to your home”.</p>
