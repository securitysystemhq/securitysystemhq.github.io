If you can link all your smart home devices into a voice control unit, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, then that's even better.</p>
<p>Of the many types of burglar alarm, one of the biggest defining factors for a system is whether the alarm is wired or wireless. This means when your alarm is activated and your monitoring company gets the signal, they will try to call the location to cancel the alarm.

<p>Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council, says: Fire-alarm systems and smoke alarms are life-safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
