<p>If you are serious about home security then you will at least need an Outdoor CCTV Camera. Cameras include Greet for the front door, Pivot for indoor monitoring, Torch Pro for lighting up and monitoring outdoors. ADT Motion Sensor Protection embeds advanced safety methods into your home security system. Wireless video surveillance has become an important and integral part of our security system. A supervisory control panel or monitor station would normally be used to keep tabs on all individual panels.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>You will also need to choose which installation option you prefer for your alarm system: professional or DIY. For example, if a customer claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, or that an employee was rude or provided misinformation, video surveillance records can be used to determine whether they were in the store on the day in question, and what, in fact, took place. SiteService remotely connects to any AK SC 255, AK SC 355, or AK SM 800 series Danfoss control system and gives you a full visualization of live plant status, alarm management, system performance history, and component settings.</p>
