<p>Vivint's other devices such as sensors and outdoor and doorbell cameras are equally high-end and compatible with 3rd party smart home devices. These systems count on someone discovering the fire and alerting the rest of the building by appropriately activating the alarm system.

<p>In late 1990s, the digital cameras came into the market, they were built on Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) based image sensor whose performance is better and are cheaper than Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD). Consequently, those living in an apartment building should seriously consider an additional line of defence to protect their property, with burglar alarms as their number one priority. Whether you're interested in video doorbells or full security camera systems , decide if you need a wired or wireless setup and consider some of the features that surveillance cameras offer.</p>

However, you need to remind yourself that while there are outdoor cameras equipped with high tech functions and features, you only need to choose one that meets your needs, budget and lifestyle. Call points or pulls belong to manually-controlled fire alarm systems.</p>
