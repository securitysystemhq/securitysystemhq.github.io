<p>It lets you arm and disarm your home security system, control smart devices and check in on your home - from virtually anywhere. CCTV security cameras are beginning to transition to digital. However, a computer system equipped with video analytics software, teamed with a skilled human, can effectively monitor many cameras.

Currently, Ring Alarm and the professional monitoring service are available only within the U.S. (excluding American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada (excluding Quebec). Video surveillance cameras have two main types of connections: wired or wireless.
