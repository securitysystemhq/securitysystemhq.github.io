<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature.

<p>So the alarm vendors have reacted to the queries and qualms of pet owners about the problem of pets setting off a false alarm, and designed burglar-alarm that take pets into consideration. If hallways are longer than 40 feet between the sleeping and living areas, use two smoke detectors.

<h3>Security Camera Systems and Surveillance in Wellington OH 44090</h3>
<p>Simple smoke detectors work quite effectively to alert you if a fire started in your home, but they are only good if you are home to put the fire off straight away.
