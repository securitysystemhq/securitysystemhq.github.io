<p>Although a proposed ordinance requiring all establishments with liquor licenses to install cameras that feed into the monitoring center was abandoned in the face of opposition, several bars accused of violating liquor laws have entered consent decrees with the city's Alcoholic Beverage Control board, requiring them to do just that.
