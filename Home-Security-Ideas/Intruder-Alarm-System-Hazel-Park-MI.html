<p>Just like with any other electronic that you will own, fire alarms and smoke alarms do not last forever. Many people installing a home surveillance system will try to place the cameras high enough that they cannot be tampered with, but are so high the camera can only see the top of the intruder's head. Spy Cameras - these are covert cameras that record images or footage without being visible. Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. The modern fire alarm system is capable of detecting smoke and heat from a small flame, water flow in a sprinkler system or an activated pull station, and reporting this information to on-site personnel via dedicated phone line to any location in the world.</p>

Generally, home security systems involve two types, the indoor and outdoor alarm systems. Fire detectors can be heat, smoke or carbon monoxide sensors. Retail, enterprises, and banks & financial institutions, among others, are the leading applications of video surveillance systems due to rise in demand for video security systems in these applications.</p>
<p>When you are selecting your burglar alarm system, you will have to decide what kind of sensors you want. In a digital video recorder (DVR), videos are recorded from a surveillance camera on a hard disk.

<p>Network video recorder (NVR) supports IP cameras only, however, to support analog cameras it requires an encoder. There are also some alarms systems, which do not sound an alarm but instead send a notification to your phone as soon as your system is activated. If your smoke alarms go off when you cook, you need a photoelectric alarm. The UK is recognised as a leading user of CCTV and the public are used to seeing CCTV cameras on virtually every high street.</p>
