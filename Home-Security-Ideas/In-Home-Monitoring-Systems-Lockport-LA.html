Stability for the Ultra Series NVRs is ensured by using RAID and N+1 hot spare, ensuring smooth and reliable video streaming and recording. All installed components, including sensors, are linked to a control panel. A few years ago, you'd need to budget thousands in order to create a video monitoring, web-connected, home security system, but today you can install a few affordable wireless sensors, a connected motion-sensing camera and enjoy 24-7 home monitoring, with alerts sent direct to your phone from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>One of the most popular and cost effective ways of providing security in the home and place of work is with cctv cameras and equipment.
