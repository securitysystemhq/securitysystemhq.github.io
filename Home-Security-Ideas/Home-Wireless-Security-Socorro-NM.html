Box surveillance camera is an ultra-high-resolution CCTV camera made with the new image sensor processor which is capable of capturing video at 700 TV lines of resolution in color and black & white, 960H CCTV resolution.</p>
<p>Web-based intruder alarm systems may include the use of distributed nets ("grids"), giving each node the ability to dynamically configure its functions within entire respect for the security scope issues. Some of these cameras even have digital video recorder capabilities to video the recordings at a later time.
