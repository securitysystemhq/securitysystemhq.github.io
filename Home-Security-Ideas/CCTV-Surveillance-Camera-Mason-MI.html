<p>Having a home security system isn't just about protecting your home and family, it's about your peace of mind as well. A 7-inch wireless touchscreen panel sits at the heart of the platform, supporting 250 third-party smart home devices like thermostats, lights, and doors as well as ADT's own home security hardware There's support for remote device control from ADT's new mobile app, home automation scenes and geofenced actions, triggering lights and unlocking your front door, for example, as you approach your home.</p>

<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time. The city has since adopted a new partnership with General Electric in which street lights are equipped with cameras and microphones. In a large public building additional fire safety features will be required - such as ceiling sprinkler systems and elaborate communications devices - that are not required on private properties.</p>
