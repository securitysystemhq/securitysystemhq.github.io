It is during the testing of your alarm system you will see if any problems have occurred in relation to the burglar alarm battery. Dialler burglar alarms automatically dial your phone number, or that of nominated friends and family, when the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council, says: Fire-alarm systems and smoke alarms are life-safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters.
