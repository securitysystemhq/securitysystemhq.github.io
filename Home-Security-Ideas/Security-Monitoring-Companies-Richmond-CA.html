<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>The center gives an edge in monitoring operations & managing maintenance of all connected sites, providing instant insights and real-time proactive action - ensuring maximum generation & uptime. With this information, the role and interaction of these supplemental fire safety systems in the protection process can then be better realized. Your video surveillance system can be tailored to your requirements with many cameras and configurations available.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad.

Provide a current copy of the installer's state license to the Miami-Dade Police Department's False Alarm Enforcement Unit (FAEU). When combined with face recognition , surveillance camera networks raise additional privacy and civil rights concerns—particularly because face recognition data is prone to error.</p>
<p>If the fire alarm system is addressable, the source of the occurrence will be pointed on the control panel. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity.
