In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two protective light beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses and shaped to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photoelectric means and means responsive to the varying voltage for operating an alarm system.</p>

<p>While other home security cameras only let you peek in, Ping creates a direct video-chat hotline between you and your household. Provides information about applications of smoke detectors used in conjunction with fire alarm systems. An Infra Red Filter is applied automatically to provide the best images during the day and night and allows the cameras to see Infrared light.
