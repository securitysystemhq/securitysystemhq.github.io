<p>Just like with any other electronic that you will own, fire alarms and smoke alarms do not last forever. Many people installing a home surveillance system will try to place the cameras high enough that they cannot be tampered with, but are so high the camera can only see the top of the intruder's head. Spy Cameras - these are covert cameras that record images or footage without being visible. Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. The modern fire alarm system is capable of detecting smoke and heat from a small flame, water flow in a sprinkler system or an activated pull station, and reporting this information to on-site personnel via dedicated phone line to any location in the world.</p>

It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.

A non-monitored burglar alarm system operates on a ‘bells only' basis - in other words, when triggered, its only function is sounding an alarm to alert neighbours and hopefully scare off the intruder.</p>
<p>Because the DVR you choose will be recording the images your security system captures, it's as important a part of the total system as the cameras themselves. CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes. Forecasting and Post-Event Investigations: The usefulness of surveillance technology in preventing and solving crimes depends on the resources put into it. The most effective systems are those which are monitored by trained staff, have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress, and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities.</p>

Equipped with a back-illuminated sensor, these cameras provide exceptional low light performance, to the extent that they produce color images in light as low as 0.01 lux.</p>
<p>Network cameras can be used for very cheap surveillance solutions (requiring one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV installations (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs , and CCTV monitors become computers with TFT screens and specialised software.
