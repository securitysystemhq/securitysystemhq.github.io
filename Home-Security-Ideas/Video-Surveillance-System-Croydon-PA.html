<h3>What to Think about Before You Buy a Home Security System in Croydon</h3>
<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do. What this means to the consumers is a sharper, crisper, and more detailed picture than what is achieved with analog. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>Whilst IP CCTV has been available for around 10 years, it is only in the last few years that the technology has matured, leading to the developments in Megapixel and High Definition (HD) technology. Again, when using video surveillance systems, the idea may be to let people know that they are being watched in order to keep them in line.

As the crime rate is increasing day by day and burglars are becoming smarter by every passing day, the security system for commercial setups likebanks, shops and houses need to be fool proof.
