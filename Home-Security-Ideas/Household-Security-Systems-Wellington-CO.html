<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>The Multi-sensor detectors combine inputs from both optical and heat sensors and process them using a sophisticated algorithm built into the detector circuitry. When one of these initiating devices is triggered, the control panel will go into an alarm state. Wireless” usually refers to the use of wireless technology like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for monitoring and to connect the components of your system.
