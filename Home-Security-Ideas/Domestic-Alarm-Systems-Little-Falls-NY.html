<p>The company wanted to create a comprehensive security device without using wi-fi-connected cameras, which are controversial but increasingly common thanks to product families like the Google-owned Nest and Amazon's Ring. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that's the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>

With the built-in GPS & Bluetooth module and the internal HD camera, the PVR provides multiple functionalities, such as positioning, picture capturing, video and audio recording, a walkie-talkie function and more. Like indoor security cameras, they can be integrated as part of a home security system or used individually to up the security level around your home.</p>
<p>Most have motion detection settings that only record footage when the camera detects movement. However, with the proper placement of the wireless sensors in your home, your wireless home security alarm system will be just as secure - if not more - than a hardwired system. There are also alarm systems which could be accessed from a remote location allowing you to see what is going on around. This could come in different types and one good example is a CCTV security system which is obtained though placing of video cameras in strategic locations in and around your home.</p>
<p>You can buy additional components individually to extend your protection, or purchase one of the larger Alarm Security Kit bundles. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%). The recording of the video feeds from CCTV cameras will be stored for 30 days for playback, post event analysis and for investigation purposes.</p>
