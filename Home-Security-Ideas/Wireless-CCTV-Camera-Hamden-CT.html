<p>Fire alarms vary in complexity and control. Analog system uses video cassette recorder (VCR) to store footage received from security camera. We are offering Burglar Alarm Panel to our client. Manage cameras and recordings with Digital Video Recorders that provide great compression technology and an easy-to-use user interface. Each intruder alarm system is one of the vertices (red marks) of the correspondent rectangle which is associated to one of the security areas.</p>

Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. This isn't the cheapest package Protect America offers, but we think it provides solid home security that's still affordable. Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>
<p>All these sensors work in tandem with other sensors and the IP camera so that the central control device sends warnings and notifications to your smartphones. The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm.
