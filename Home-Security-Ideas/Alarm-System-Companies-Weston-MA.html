<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
<p>Check out our comprehensive review to compare top alarm systems and features. Quick action is important during break-ins, and burglar alarms facilitate fast response by alerting people in the vicinity to compromised security as soon as it occurs.

Sometimes they are referred to as lipstick cameras. With over 400 cameras installed across the City, video surveillance has become another critical and valuable resource for public safety. When the photosensitive elements receive enough optical signals, the electrode distortion is generated to trigger the alarm signal 26 But its shortcomings are also very obvious: water mist from kitchen, cooking fumes, and even the haze in winter are likely to trigger the smoke sensor, resulting in frequent false positives.</p>

C-mount cameras can cover distances beyond 40 ft thanks to the possibility to use special lenses with these cameras, whereas standard CCTV lenses can only cover distances of 35-40 ft. It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing.</p>
