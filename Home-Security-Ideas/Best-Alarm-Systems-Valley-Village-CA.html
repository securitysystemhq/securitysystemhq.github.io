The input from an analog camera is encoded and output a digital stream for transmission over an IP network. The alarm itself is wired in low-voltage cable, but the control panel usually needs a connection to mains electricity via a fused connection unit. Being the network supported by a structure with Internet access, all monitoring and control, and programmer settings are reachable form any part of the globe (by using several internet access equipments, with different access privileges).</p>
