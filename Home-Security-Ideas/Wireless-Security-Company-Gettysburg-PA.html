<p>Most office buildings, school, hospitals and homes today have fire alarm systems installed. Once you've installed your system, simply connect the DVR to your internet router or modem and you can view your cameras anywhere in the world at no additional charge.

It is sometimes the case where an alarm panel or wiring is attacked by an intruder and oftentimes the equipment is damaged beyond repair.</p>
