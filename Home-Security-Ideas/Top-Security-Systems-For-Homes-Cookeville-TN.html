Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. In some cases, people will mount signs in their front yards alerting potential intruders that surveillance cameras are in operation. These sensors are positioned strategically around a premises and can detect motion, and trigger the alarm countdown.</p>
