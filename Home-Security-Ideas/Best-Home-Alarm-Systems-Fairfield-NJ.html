<p>While outdoor cameras are really useful devices, have you ever wondered how they work? Provide cellular connectivity and management support, making them ideal for use in remote patient monitoring, clinical trials or for health visitors and social workers. For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, causing more than 100 of the cameras to go dark. Panic alarms receive police response based on fear of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally receive fire response based on an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>The Firex is easy to install and can be interconnected with other alarms to create a full-house smoke detection system. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees. The basic plan provides users with three wireless door sensors and one wireless motion sensor.
