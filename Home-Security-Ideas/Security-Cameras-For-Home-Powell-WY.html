<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>
<p>Security guards are watching these cameras to detect any suspicious activity. 6Ring does not own its own professional monitoring center but works with a leader in the industry to provide this service.

A:In order to find out if someone tried to break into your house or it was a false alarm, you would need to check if the alarm was triggered because of incorrect key codes, if you ran into the house without disarming the system, or your pet moved into the sight of a motion detector.</p>
<p>Again, motion sensors should only trigger when your home is in danger. Yes it a great idea to install CCTV Cameras to protect from terrorism. Some cameras even record videos and images and store them in a digital storage device such as a DVR. Such systems also come with a remote that is much like the remote control you use in your car alarm. Therefore, detectors will be placed in escape routes, although this may not be suitable depending on the risk assessment or if the size and complexity of a building are increased.</p>
