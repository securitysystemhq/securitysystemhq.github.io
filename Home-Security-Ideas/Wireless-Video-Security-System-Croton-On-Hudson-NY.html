The number of features included in your system, and the monitoring choices you make will cause a the price of installing a security system fluctuate greatly.</p>
<p>All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are created equal. The developed system is comprised of wearable sensors, Android handheld device, and web interface.
