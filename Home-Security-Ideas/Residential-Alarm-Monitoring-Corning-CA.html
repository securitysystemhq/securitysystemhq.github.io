<p>CCTV security cameras have come a long way since being first introduced into the market in the late 1960's. We deal in a wide assortment of products including video surveillance systems, time attendance system, finger print based time attendance system, card based time and attendance system, biometric (finger print) door lock, CCTV camera system, IR camera, night vision camera, networking multi-doors controller, box camera, PTZ dome camera, dome camera, heat detectors, PIR sensor, long distance inductive guard tour system and guard tour system for non-security personnel.</p>

<p>In some cases, anyone could open a browser window and view a camera's live video stream and witness the plate captures in real time. Along an automobile assembly line, video surveillance cameras are also used to monitor the totally automated installation of the windshield and rear-window.

<p>In addition, the equipment and installation costs may vary by company, so you can save by comparison shopping. Maintenance employees can use video surveillance cameras to detect equipment that needs repair and equipment that is operating in an unsafe manner. IP cameras are far more powerful than analog cameras, usually shooting footage of between 1 megapixel and 5 megapixels.
