<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>Many residents and businesses are now utilizing surveillance cameras and these cameras may capture persons and events without the owner's knowledge and this captured information may help the police department solve crimes and help keep the Borough safe. The Smonet outdoor security camera is equipped with night vision, wide-angle lens and 720p HD video quality. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small.</p>
