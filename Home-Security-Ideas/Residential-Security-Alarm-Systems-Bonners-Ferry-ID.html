<p>Every now and then you may find yourself in a position where one of your security cameras has stopped working. They can perform all the functions of a digital video recorder mentioned above and adds support for IP and megapixel cameras. Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services. Fire safety begins with fire detection, and fire detection means everything from components—sensors, initiating devices, annunciators, and control panels—to integrated systems.</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
<p>If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensors and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment.
