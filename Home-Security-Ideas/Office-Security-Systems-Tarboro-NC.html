<p>CCTV camera security systems are the popular equipments used for security purposes now days. That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>Stream your home cameras through your phone, arm your alarm system, and control all of your home devices from the same app. Abode also offers a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensor and one motion detector. They usually work on two principles: heat detection and smoke detection. By linking them with police control room, on the event of robbery or theft, the alarm will self-operate and send a message to the nearby PCR vans.</p>

Many DIY home security vendors offer the option of buying components by the piece so you can create a custom home alarm system.

<p>Wired alarm systems use a low-voltage current that flows between two points throughout the home's entry points, and breaking the circuit will result in the alarm being triggered; wireless alarm systems use built-in radio frequency transmitters where the signal is transmitted to the control panel and the alarm is activated.

Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. Monitored home security systems cost between $20 and $60 per month. Note: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and leave out the old analog cameras, given that everyone favors IP cameras today for their affordable prices, features and easy setup.</p>

Some cameras even record videos and images and store them in a digital storage device such as a DVR. Such systems also come with a remote that is much like the remote control you use in your car alarm.
