<p>Having a home security system isn't just about protecting your home and family, it's about your peace of mind as well. A 7-inch wireless touchscreen panel sits at the heart of the platform, supporting 250 third-party smart home devices like thermostats, lights, and doors as well as ADT's own home security hardware There's support for remote device control from ADT's new mobile app, home automation scenes and geofenced actions, triggering lights and unlocking your front door, for example, as you approach your home.</p>

Driven by the force of providing that much-needed leap for India to advance in the smart home sector, we aim to come up with quality devices that are reliable, easy to use and most of all, affordable.</p>
