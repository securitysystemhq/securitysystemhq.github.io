<p>The company wanted to create a comprehensive security device without using wi-fi-connected cameras, which are controversial but increasingly common thanks to product families like the Google-owned Nest and Amazon's Ring. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>Whether you have a photoelectric alarm or an ionization detector, regular cleaning will keep your smoke alarm in working order. For data security, the smartphone keeps history of the records in SD card memory. All of the top DVR systems have USB ports for external storage devices and LAN-based video servers are common.
