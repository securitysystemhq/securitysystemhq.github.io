<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Most DIY systems are easy to install and are sold as kits that you can configure to suit your specific needs. Pro Series Doorbells provide video intercom functionality, supporting communication with the master station and the indoor station. The mobile and IP communications have developed and completely changed the way we now use, monitor and control intruder security systems. After a certain number of false alarms, the police won't respond to any call-outs.</p>
<p>The newest technology in camera surveillance is the use of computers to interpret the data. The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device.

<p>What makes matters worse is that the hardware is proprietary and is useless if you try to use it with another security company or use it without monitoring. Fire prevention: Preventing break-ins is only one part of a security setup; most systems also offer protection against fire and carbon monoxide, although those devices cost extra. A CCTV unit will need to be installed by a professional, but if you own a very large property then the cost is definitely worth it. They can be placed both externally and internally and the DVR playback is easy and straightforward.</p>
<p>The rapid growth in technology has remarkably enhanced the scope of remote health monitoring systems. IP video cameras are a great option for monitoring your home or business from a remote location. The proposed real-time monitoring system is compatible to use various wearable sensors to extract medical information which helps finding out multiple parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body and skin temperature at the same time.</p>

<p>Such systems continue to enjoy general public support but they do involve intrusion into the lives of ordinary people as they go about their day to day business and can raise wider privacy concerns. When you place a security company's sticker in a front window and plant their sign in your front yard, you are telling burglars you home is professionally protected and not a wise choice for an attempted burglary.</p>

<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
