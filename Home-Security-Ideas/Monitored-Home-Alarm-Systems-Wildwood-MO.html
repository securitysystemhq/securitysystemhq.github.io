<p>One might think that the function of a fire alarm is to provide you with important evidence about a fire existing, allowing you to change your policy accordingly and exit the building. This section will describe the basic aspects of fire detection and alarm systems. By utilizing solid state storage on each camera, the MV family has removed the network video recorder (NVR) and its complexity from the equation.

It also supports a huge list of camera manufacturers (including IP cameras) so you aren't locked into a specific camera vendor or limited to a specific type of video capture hardware.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>Complete, high-quality audio systems to improve security, make live or scheduled announcements, or create ambience with great-sounding background music. If you have large pets, you might want to consider skipping the motion sensors and rely more on the window and door sensors which aren't triggered by movement but are triggered when a window or door is opened.

DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
