<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Think of the alarm system connected to the door. Security cameras can keep an eye out for criminal activity, but they also give family members the ability to monitor the person and the home remotely.

<p>Today's video surveillance systems aren't just about security cameras.

<h3>Home Security Systems: More Than Just With An Alarm In Place in Youngsville</h3>
<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do. What this means to the consumers is a sharper, crisper, and more detailed picture than what is achieved with analog. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
