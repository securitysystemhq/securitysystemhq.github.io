<p>Having a home security system isn't just about protecting your home and family, it's about your peace of mind as well. A 7-inch wireless touchscreen panel sits at the heart of the platform, supporting 250 third-party smart home devices like thermostats, lights, and doors as well as ADT's own home security hardware There's support for remote device control from ADT's new mobile app, home automation scenes and geofenced actions, triggering lights and unlocking your front door, for example, as you approach your home.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety. In fact, I can't recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire. In the event of an intrusion or life safety event, the alarm siren on the ADT Security Hub will be activated and an alert will be sent to your smartphone but ADT will not be notified.</p>
