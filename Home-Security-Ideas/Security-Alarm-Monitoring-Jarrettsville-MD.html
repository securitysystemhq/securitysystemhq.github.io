<p>The importance of a properly installed fire alarm system is not to be overlooked. Along with high resolution images, Matrix IP cameras decrease storage costs by offering latest H.265 Compression technology. Finally, experts state that a home without an alarm system is three times more likely to be burglarized than a home with a professionally monitored system installed. With the latest smart home technology from your favourite security brands, deterring burglars and detecting trespassers has never been easier.</p>
<p>Today there's a lot more to a home security camera than video surveillance. In a remote monitoring approach, combined with Risk Based Monitoring , you are moving away from 100% SDV onsite. I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>
<p>The choice is really up to you, but seeing how the alarm is a key component in any home security system, you should try to spend more here instead of on less practical components such as motion detectors and the likes. Remote Monitoring Service guarantees notification of any issues that may become significant through a personal customer call.

Note too that security systems aren't just about crime prevention: Most have add-on sensors that can protect your home from fire, flood, and even temperature changes (to prevent pipes from bursting, for one thing).</p>
<p>10. The Lowest Total Cost Of Ownership: When you compare the cost per camera, and the flexibility and performance a network camera gives you, it makes sense to go with the Network IP camera. This Lorex security camera also connects to your network video recorder (NVR) to create up to four zones with adjustable motion sensitivity for each.

<p>IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires. You may see the reputable security companies offering free home security systems, but these usually include a contract and a monthly monitoring fee.</p>

Maintenance employees can use video surveillance cameras to detect equipment that needs repair and equipment that is operating in an unsafe manner. IP cameras are far more powerful than analog cameras, usually shooting footage of between 1 megapixel and 5 megapixels.

It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing.</p>
<p>If an incompatible IP camera is used with an NVR, such changes will not be communicated to the IP camera, and changes will not apply before video is encoded by the camera. There are a few other questions you might want to consider before you select your burglar alarm system.
