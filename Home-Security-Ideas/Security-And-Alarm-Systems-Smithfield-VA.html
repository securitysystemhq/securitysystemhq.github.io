<p>Network cameras can be used for very cheap surveillance solutions (requiring one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV installations (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs , and CCTV monitors become computers with TFT screens and specialised software. In my view it is the best security system with low cost of ownership.
