<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>Bullet Cameras: Bullet security cameras are a type video surveillance camera that are typically small and shaped like a rifle bullet shell or lipstick case. Monitoring employees using employee video surveillance can be a high risk, high reward situation for an employer. Software Description: Hikvision card Windows SDK V6.5 supports to develop software for DS-4300 series card under the Windows environment. In a video clip released by Maktoob Media, students can be seen pushing furniture to block the library door, which the police tear down to enter, on December 15. A woman, who appears to be a security guard, is allowed to leave as the police enter the library.</p>
<p>This is a kind of artificial intelligence that is called "video analytics", and is potentially beneficial for efficient use of surveillance cameras, but this technology has sometimes been significantly oversold by the surveillance camera industry. But, according to security experts, pound-for-pound, having a monitored home alarm security system, which they strongly emphasize MUST be a good and reliable brand, is perhaps the best and SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION that one could institute in having a home that scares away potential burglars and keeps them away from your home, and your family safety.</p>

By installing a security system, you actually deter break ins because once the would-be thief discovers the alarm (either by noticing the manufacturers sticker in the window or triggering the siren) he will most likely bolt.</p>
