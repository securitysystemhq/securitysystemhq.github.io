<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>These cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. This isn't the cheapest package Protect America offers, but we think it provides solid home security that's still affordable. Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>

However, it is important to ensure the reliability and safe operation of fire-fighting equipment and installed systems such as fire alarms and emergency lighting.</p>
