<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>We provide burglar alarms which utilize the most recent innovation to secure your belonging and can be customized to suit your particular needs. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets or security personnel on patrolling and physical surveillance.

<p>In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm. Most modern home security systems do not require a landline and rely off of cellular and wireless connectivity.
