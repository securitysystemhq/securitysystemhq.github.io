You'll find security providers that offer smart home devices, and those who mainly offer integration, meaning that the security system will work well with devices from different manufacturers.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that, based on the proposed intelligent smoke alarm system, the air condition can be more accurately distinguished, and the probability of false alarms is greatly reduced, so that the air information can be viewed in real time and the alarm information can be received in a timely manner. The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system.</p>
