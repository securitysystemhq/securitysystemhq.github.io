<p>Allowing this data to do far more for businesses than security alone.

<p>Most wireless security cameras operate on the 2.4 Ghz frequency band and have a range between 300 and 600 feet depending on obstructions between the camera and receiving unit. HDCVI cameras also tend to be less expensive and are simpler to install and maintain in large scale surveillance systems.

<p>The Mi security camera has an incredible design and gives such an amazing 1080 full HD images and video quality. The HD cameras can be set with a very specific monitoring zone, so there's no need for traditional two-piece door or window sensors. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.</p>
<p>CCTV involves the use of an unmanned, remotely mounted video camera system, transmitting live pictures back to a television screen where developments can be monitored and recorded.

<p>Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
