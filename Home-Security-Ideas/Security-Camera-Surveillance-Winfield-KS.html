<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system.

<p>Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council, says: Fire-alarm systems and smoke alarms are life-safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters.

Video image processing ( VIP ) identifies vehicles and their associated traffic flow parameters by analysing imagery supplied from CCTV cameras which normally have a fixed field of view. However, they fail in around thirty percent of all fires allowing more tragic deaths to occur than should be.

These devices have a lower price than the wireless systems, and since they are wired, you don't have to worry about batteries to power the system.</p>
