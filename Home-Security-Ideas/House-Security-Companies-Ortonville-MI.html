<p>Is there any place in your plant which is not suitable for a person to stay there to monitor important process? There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>

Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance.</p>
<p>That competition has nudged third-party operators to step up their technology to the point where their technology and training can stack up against just about any in-house monitoring service.

Coax is stiff, larger than other cables, and incapable of transmitting audio, so DVR systems often have to run large amounts of cabling through walls and ceilings to connect each camera to the DVR.</p>

Security cameras that are equipped with motion sensors give them the capability of detecting movements. Other common causes for false alarms can relate to the system technology.
