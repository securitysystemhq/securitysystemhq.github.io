The camera transmits a signal to the receiving unit that can store the video signal in a proprietary DVR unit or in some cases directly onto a computer hard drive. Dusty buildup can lead to false alarms or delayed detection during an emergency. Installing a particular security monitoring system can certainly help cause you less of a burglar's target.</p>
