<p>And the software also provides other functions, like wiper control, editing password, restoring default settings, and batch upgrading. Directly attached storage are the hard drives that are located outside of the digital video recorder, network video recorder or server. Some providers have motion sensors that are designed to be pet-friendly, avoiding pets under 80 pounds to help prevent false alarms. Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>
<p>Such cameras have been equipped with Infrared lights that can provide security all day and night. Other home security components include motion sensors, keypads, key fobs, cameras, glass-break sensors, and panic buttons. Professional installation is available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. CCTV camera systems need a power source in order to function.
