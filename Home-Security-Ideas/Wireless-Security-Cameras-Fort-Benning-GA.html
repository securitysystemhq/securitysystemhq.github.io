<p>Activity monitors were defined as an 'electronic device that lets someone who lives outside your home know if you are okay, or if your daily routine changes.'

<p>Ring (owned by Amazon since 2018) is first and foremost a smart home technology company. However, the 24-hour service offered by monitoring may make you feel more secure, and the company will be liable if no action is taken in the event of a burglary. The monitoring plan should retain flexibility to increase on-site monitoring in case of issues or problems - for example, sites with a high number of protocol violations or poor data quality may require additional visits to teach and mentor study staff, or conversely sites with low adverse event rates contradictory to predictions or other site metrics.</p>
