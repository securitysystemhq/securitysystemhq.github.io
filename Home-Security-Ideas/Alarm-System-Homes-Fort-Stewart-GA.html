When the output value is repeated several times for the set alarm value, that is, when the fire generates smoke, the alarm is pushed. As shown in Figure 7 , the intelligent smoke alarm system consists of a smoke detection module, wireless communication module, and intelligent identification and data visualization module. Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>
