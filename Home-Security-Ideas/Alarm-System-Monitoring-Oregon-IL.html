<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>One of the most popular and cost effective ways of providing security in the home and place of work is with cctv cameras and equipment. Another great feature, in addition to the basic home security equipment, is the array of home automation features that allow you to remotely access, monitor, and control your security system and other equipment in your home. This service enables ABB to actively participate in ongoing system monitoring and process optimization.</p>
