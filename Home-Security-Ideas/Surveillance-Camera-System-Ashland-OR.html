<p>When a door or window is closed, the two parts of the sensor are joined together, creating a security circuit. Cameras with motion detection can send you notifications when the camera observes motion within its field of view.

These devices have a lower price than the wireless systems, and since they are wired, you don't have to worry about batteries to power the system.</p>

And modern alarm sensors mean even dog and cat owners can have alarms installed that are clever enough to allow pets to roam without triggering the siren.
