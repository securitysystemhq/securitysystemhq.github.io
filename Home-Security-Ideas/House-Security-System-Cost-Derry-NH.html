CCTV cameras are limited to 4CIF, or 704 x 480, while IP cameras are well past to 3 megapixel, or 2048 x 1536.

Installation, monitoring, and equipment costs are all important factors to consider when finding the best security system for your home.</p>
<p>Then, the problem of low precision and weak timeliness of traditional smoke alarms is given. Its smart home panel lets the system learn your habits, so it knows when to turn up the heat or dim the lights based on your routine and preferences. An Intelligent Video Surveillance system basically censored the performance, happenings, or changing information usually in terms of human beings, vehicles or any other objects from a distance by means of some electronic equipment (usually digital camera).</p>
<p>The best home security monitoring companies have the infrastructure and trained operators to survive anything from a tornado to a server fire without the slightest hiccup in service. Inexpensive GSM Burglar Alarm Systems are available to protect Holiday Homes, Boats, Caravans or anywhere where there is no telephone line connected, and can even operate without mains electricity. In the past, old-school setups demanded professional installation and the nagging pain of monthly service fees.</p>

A:In order to find out if someone tried to break into your house or it was a false alarm, you would need to check if the alarm was triggered because of incorrect key codes, if you ran into the house without disarming the system, or your pet moved into the sight of a motion detector.</p>
<p>This is totally untrue that CCTV cameras can be crime solver as CCTV cameras can only reduce the crime by capturing the on going scene. The essence of a fire alarm system, as opposed to individual smoke detectors, even if they are wired to indicate in concert, is that it is supervised from a central location. In the past you'd need deep pockets to have a Yale system professionally installed (and then monitored for an extra cost) but the Smart Living range is DIY, wireless and app-controlled.</p>
