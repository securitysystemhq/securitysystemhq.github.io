There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>A stronger and more effective mechanism in the form of security cameras is to be used. 4G LTE security camera , also called cellular camera , runs on 4G data with a built-in SIM card instead of the router network to work.
