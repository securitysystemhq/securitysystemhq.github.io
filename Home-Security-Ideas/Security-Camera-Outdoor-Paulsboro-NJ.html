Wireless: Wireless security cameras transmit data either through radio frequencies or over a Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>The burglar when shorts loop wires together hides the End-of-line-resistor from the control panel, letting the control panel know that something is going on. The EOL resistor value is usually provided by the alarm system manufacturer, typically 5.6KΩ. Walter Bruch , a noted German engineer, designed and installed the system that used CCTV cameras to observe the launch of V2 rockets on monitors.

<p>Help secure your home with a smart security camera and motion sensors. In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras connected—either hardwired or wireless— to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor.
