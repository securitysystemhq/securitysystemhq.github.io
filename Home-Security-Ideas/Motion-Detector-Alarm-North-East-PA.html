<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

Excessive demand has decreased the rates of these CCTV Cameras.</p>
