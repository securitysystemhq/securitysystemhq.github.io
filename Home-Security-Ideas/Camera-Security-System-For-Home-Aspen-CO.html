<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>Security guards are watching these cameras to detect any suspicious activity. 6Ring does not own its own professional monitoring center but works with a leader in the industry to provide this service. LifeShield from ADT is completely wireless with pet-friendly sensors. Moreover, cameras can be placed in areas that require security such as parking spots, VIP areas, schools, restaurants & hotels, bank locker rooms, hospitals, etc.</p>
