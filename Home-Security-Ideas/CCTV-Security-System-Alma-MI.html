<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>DC Power Splitter - 1 to 2 Y Cable This DC Power Adapter Y Cable Pigtail splits 1 power signal into 2 and is useful for powering multiple cameras from one central adapter. A disadvantage is that for large buildings, they can be expensive to install because of the extensive amounts of wire that are necessary to accurately monitor initiating devices. It allows users to remotely store, manage, record, play, and monitor surveillance footage entirely on the cloud or on secure servers.</p>
<p>Smart home automation features for a more robust security system. Fire-alarm control panels (FACP) or fire-alarm control units (FACU) consist of electric panels that function as the controlling components of a fire-alarm system Figure 9.35). On the contrary, some security camera providers offer cloud storage monthly plans to securely store videos on the cloud. Alert systems can also close fire doors, recall elevators, and interface and monitor the installed suppression systems, such as sprinklers.</p>

<p>For example, you can probably get a free smoke detector, or a free additional door sensor or motion sensor along with the main home security package. The security conscious had to wait until the next century for further alarm system advances, which heralded the advent of the transistor and the integrated circuit.
