<p>A fire alarm is a fire safety device that is utilised to alert the public about a fire outbreak. When comparing video at the same angle of view (zoom length), higher resolution video provides facial detail farther away when using digital zoom for magnification. A passkey has also been assigned for secured data acquisition from sensors to the listening port of the smartphone. Nest Secure makes our list of best home alarm systems partially due to all the neat gadgets that come along with it. While it's definitely not the least expensive of the DIY installation home security options, at $399 there's a reason why the starter kit is listed at that price.</p>

Axis AX is a complete system of high performance fire panels, audio systems, command centres and high performance devices.

<p>The Nest Cam IQ is Nest's latest outdoor, IP66-certified Wi-Fi-enabled camera. Alder doesn't advertise pricing for its security systems online, and since each customer's individual system may vary, the price may vary as well.

As a rule, any of the local security companies with brands that you are not aware of, typically have ADT, Brinks or Monotronics behind them doing the actual monitoring.</p>
