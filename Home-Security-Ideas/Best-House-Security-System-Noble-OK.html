<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>Whenever the alarm in your home burglar alarm system sounds, and you do not enter the pass code immediately to terminate the alarm, your local law enforcement will be contacted. The best place to find a suitable home security alarm monitoring company is to go online and research companies offering this service in your immediate location. You can focus instead on how quickly the service which monitors your home burglar alarm system will notify local law enforcement, the size of your residence, and your budget.</p>

<p>This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit.

IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. LifeShield's smart DIY security systems range in price from around $300 to $500, and you can get professional monitoring without a contract.
