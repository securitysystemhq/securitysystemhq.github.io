<p>In order to know about burglar alarms and how they work, one has to compare them to a simple electric circuit or appliance. Regardless of whether it is an IP camera that has turned out to be generally acknowledged or HD-SDI cameras broadcasting in superior quality, they both can give up to full 1080p HD determination surveillance pictures.

Real human guards watch your cameras in real-time so there are no false alarms.
