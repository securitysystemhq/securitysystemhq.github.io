<p>So you're interested in purchasing a CCTV camera for either home security or for commercial use, but you don't know what type of camera to purchase? For microcontroller MC2 , keypad is connected to port 1 and LCD display is connected to port 2 and motor driver is connected to pins P1.2 and P1.3 and touch sensor is connected to pin P1.4. Motion detector is connected to pin P3.3 and taken as a input interrupt (INT1) to the microcontroller 2. The password request switch is connected to pin P3.2 and taken as a input interrupt (INT0) to the microcontroller.</p>
<p>No, not all providers offer security cameras in their equipment packages. The commonest excuse for the deployment of CCTV cameras is in the prevention and detection of crime. Fire sprinklers utilize water by direct application onto flames and heat, which causes cooling of the combustion process and prevents ignition of adjacent combustibles.

<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely. They are great for those in rented accommodation as they can be removed just as easily as they were installed so when you move on to your new home, you can take the alarm system with you. Fire alarms reduce property loss: While strobe lights and sirens don't actively put out fires, they alert the people who can.</p>
