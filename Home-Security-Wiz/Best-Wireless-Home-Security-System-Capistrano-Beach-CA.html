<p>Prior to fire alarms, smoke detectors were primarily the main indicator for alerting the occupants of a building to a fire. Without a plan, you'll still get a quality camera with a great viewing angle. It is best if you use a local company because they are often more in-tune with what is happening in your specific area and some even offer discount fees to local residents taking up their monitoring service. DVRs come in 4, 8, 9, and 16 channel increments and this selection is critical because adding cameras above the DVR channels available will require an additional DVR, not just additional channels.</p>

<p>Multiple Users viewing: Multiple users could watch the live video from the same camera at the same time, clearly and smoothly. Most of the video surveillance systems installed in the US are for home and business security applications. If you take advantage of other smart home systems, you're missing out on what you can achieve with the security and surveillance component.
