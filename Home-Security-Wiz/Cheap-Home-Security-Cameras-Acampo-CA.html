<p>Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council, says: Fire-alarm systems and smoke alarms are life-safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>

<p>In order for a company to provide live monitoring, they must charge a monthly fee, since they will either be connecting your service to the company's central system through a landline phone or through cellular technology. Leaving windows unprotected by bars, safety locks, or a home alarm system open also draws attention and adds to easy of entry for an intruder.
