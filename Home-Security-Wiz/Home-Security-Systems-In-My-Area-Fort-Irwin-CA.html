Zephyr BT is a wearable sensor which has been used to extract heart rate information of the patients requiring continuous monitoring. At Vector Security we pride ourselves on our professional installation. While practical, some people definitely do not agree with this use of CCTV Cameras because they believe it fosters ill will and animosity between the worker and employer.
