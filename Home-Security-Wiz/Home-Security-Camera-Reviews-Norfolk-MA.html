There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>
<p>The word Surveillance has been derived from the French word sur” means from above” and veiller” means to watch.” Surveillance means to monitor behaviors, movements, activities, and information for controlling, managing, and protecting people. Our outdoor security cameras have a weather rating of IP66.
