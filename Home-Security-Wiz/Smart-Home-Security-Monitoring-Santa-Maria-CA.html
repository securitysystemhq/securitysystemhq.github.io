<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring and control (M&C) systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as factories, power plants, network operations centers, airports, and spacecraft, with some degree of automation. That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. Professionally installed systems take the trouble out of things for homeowners who don't have the time or expertise to set up all the sensors and accessories themselves.</p>
<p>Typically, you will find major components such as a control panel, alarm, sensors, and detectors in a security system. Some wireless cameras are very obvious and look like what one would consider a typical surveillance camera. Discover our range of home alarm systems today.

All of the products will be usable with or without the live monitoring service, which costs $20 per month (or $23 with unlimited video storage).</p>

Most security companies, whether they're DIY, professionally installed, professionally monitored, or self-monitored, will offer guidance if you're confused about what to choose.
