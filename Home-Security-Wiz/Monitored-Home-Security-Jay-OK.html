It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>You will want to know if the monitoring company has an additional plan in the event of a power outage at the monitoring station.
