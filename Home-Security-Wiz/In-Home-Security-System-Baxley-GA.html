<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Today's home security systems are effective and affordable. Installing number of cameras allows the security staff to watch both the customers and employees to prevent theft of shop supplies. Surveillance systems can be used to monitor your entryways and windows, and can also be monitored either by you on your smartphone or by a company if desired. Whether you're home or away, you can check your home security cameras with the ADT mobile app on your phone.</p>

<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Baxley</h3>
