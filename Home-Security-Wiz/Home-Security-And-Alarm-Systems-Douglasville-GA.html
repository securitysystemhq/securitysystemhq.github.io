<p>Many people share a grave misconception about the use and application of fire alarm systems. This security camera is pretty generic and provides a decent quality of about 720p resolution. Closed circuit television is one of the most effective and commonly used types of video surveillance available on the market, but is a step above in price from wireless cameras. It's great value for the money, and you can even try it for free for 15 days to see if you like the equipment, monitoring, and service. The misinformation of the fire alarm caused by water mist or oil smoke causes unnecessary losses to people.</p>

<p>In wireless systems, the signal from the detectors to the control panel is transmitted with radio frequency. If the camera is connected to the internet directly without a computer or DVR, you can access the video from anywhere in the world, but you will not be making a time stamped recording. Note too that security systems aren't just about crime prevention: Most have add-on sensors that can protect your home from fire, flood, and even temperature changes (to prevent pipes from bursting, for one thing).</p>
<p>Smaller systems have sensors for the main entry point and interior camera. This eliminates the need for cables, allowing installation to be much simpler than wired security cameras.

Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on gives you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away.
