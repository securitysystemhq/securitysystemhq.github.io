<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>
<p>These include sensors, smoke alarms, key fobs, panic buttons and hi-res cameras. Most security companies, whether they're DIY, professionally installed, professionally monitored, or self-monitored, will offer guidance if you're confused about what to choose.

<p>Along these lines, in spite of the way that video is being transmitted from the cameras in a simple organization, live and recorded video is as yet accessible over the system. The most basic burglar alarm works with a simple electric circuit built into an entry door or window. We have a 'model city program' in a foreign country (AFRICA) that will have 5G Communication Technology and it will need a variety of Wireless Video surveillance solutions from transportation, plate identification, government, campus video surveillance, schools, and business parks and banking institutions surveillance, commercial applications, as well as residential neighborhoods.</p>

The increasing application of CCTV cameras in government and commercial sector is expected to be primary reason for the increased demand for CCTV cameras. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording.</p>
