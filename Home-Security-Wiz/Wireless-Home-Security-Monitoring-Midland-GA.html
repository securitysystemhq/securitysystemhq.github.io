Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad.

A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>

This gives you better image quality, flexibility and scalability in a lower cost to operate than traditional CCTV cameras.</p>

<p>Our motion sensors can detect the difference between an intruder and your beloved pet move freely at your home without tripping an alarm. Surveillance camera come in all shapes and sizes and trying to figure out which surveillance system that will fit your needs can be very frustrating, but most cameras and systems today requires very little experience to install and operate.

We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
