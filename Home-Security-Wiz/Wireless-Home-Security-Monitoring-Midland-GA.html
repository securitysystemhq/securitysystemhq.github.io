<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad.

<p>Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council, says: Fire-alarm systems and smoke alarms are life-safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>All these things working in unison and correctly have often saved the lives of people who were in buildings that have caught fire. Upon receiving an alarm notification, the fire alarm control panel must now tell someone that an emergency is underway. For one, cameras should avoid or mask inappropriate views of private areas, such as yards and windows of bedrooms or washrooms. This gives you better image quality, flexibility and scalability in a lower cost to operate than traditional CCTV cameras.</p>

<p>Our motion sensors can detect the difference between an intruder and your beloved pet move freely at your home without tripping an alarm. Surveillance camera come in all shapes and sizes and trying to figure out which surveillance system that will fit your needs can be very frustrating, but most cameras and systems today requires very little experience to install and operate.

<p>Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
