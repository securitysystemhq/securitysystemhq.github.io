<p>CCTV cameras also known as close circuit television have been a part of our lives since the year 1942 when they were first used by Siemens AG to observe the take-off of V2 rockets in Nazi Germany. They are small, portable, and can often be programmed so you can view surveillance footage via the internet, which means you can even check on your home while you're on vacation. It's also used by the control panel to monitor the state (alarm or no alarm) of the initiating devices and zone wiring.
