<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself. But there are also several drawbacks when you opt to use a smoke alarm instead of the fire alarm panel. The rising awareness regarding the benefits of CCTV cameras in commercial sector is also increasing the demand for CCTV cameras.
