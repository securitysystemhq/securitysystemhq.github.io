That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire departmentâ€”so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>

The cameras were all configured accordingly and put through their paces one by one to test all functionally of the camera as well as image quality.</p>
<p>Installing a video surveillance camera for providing nonstop images from the area where it is required makes the users quite safe and ready for any unforeseen incident. At GSX 2019, Bosch introduced a significant expansion of its video portfolio with the introduction of more than 50 new products, including fixed and moving cameras, and recording and management solutions. When your video cameras are installed, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the central station.</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>
