Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

<p>The circuit alarm magnetic switches described above are ideal for protecting opening windows and doors of a house, but they don't always provide sufficient all round protection.
