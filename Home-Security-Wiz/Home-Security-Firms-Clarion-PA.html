<p>Fire alarms are important security devices which help to seek protection against fire accidents. If you have an Xfinity X1 cable TV box, you can control the system from there and watch live video from the camera. We specialize in providing an extensive range of CCTV cameras, and performing research and development in Camera DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for other renowned manufacturers. You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. Smoke detectors connected to your smart home hub are able to alert your phone, so you know when there's an emergency even when you aren't home.</p>

<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system. For a fairly modest outlay, this security camera delivers a reliable performance - provided you use the Ethernet cable, because Wi-Fi connectivity can be flaky - and a good set of features. These detectors are preset to sound an alarm when the air temperature exceeds the fixed temperature. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>
