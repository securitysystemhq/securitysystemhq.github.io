To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected.

Conversely, advanced digital cameras are those that are not connected by a circuit but can be located at any site around the world. Most fire alarms provide information about where the fire is located to emergency responders. Outdoor cameras are one of the best ways to deter (and catch) burglars, vandals, and other miscreants.</p>
<p>Dome cameras are commonly used in surveillance systems inside of homes, casinos, retail stores, and restaurants.

Unmonitored systems are available for similar costs, without the monthly follow up fee. Some of the basic features of CCTV cameras which every potential buyer should pay attention to are firstly the video cameras zoom lens, this depends on the placement of the handheld camera and the area you want it to monitor.</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>
