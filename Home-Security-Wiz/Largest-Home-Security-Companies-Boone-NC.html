<p>CCTV cameras also known as close circuit television have been a part of our lives since the year 1942 when they were first used by Siemens AG to observe the take-off of V2 rockets in Nazi Germany. They are small, portable, and can often be programmed so you can view surveillance footage via the internet, which means you can even check on your home while you're on vacation. It's also used by the control panel to monitor the state (alarm or no alarm) of the initiating devices and zone wiring. The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelesslyâ€”the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage).</p>
<p>These cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras.

<p>Even though the Lorex LBV2531 camera is analog, it still delivers 1080p high-definition picture, digital video features (like digital zoom on both live feeds and recordings), and the biggest night vision range on our list at 130 feet. Generally, home security systems involve two types, the indoor and outdoor alarm systems. Fire detectors can be heat, smoke or carbon monoxide sensors.

An alarm system's alert is triggered not only by someone entering an incorrect code through the system's control panel, but also when a motion detector senses movement inside the house.</p>
<p>All these things working in unison and correctly have often saved the lives of people who were in buildings that have caught fire. Upon receiving an alarm notification, the fire alarm control panel must now tell someone that an emergency is underway. For one, cameras should avoid or mask inappropriate views of private areas, such as yards and windows of bedrooms or washrooms.
