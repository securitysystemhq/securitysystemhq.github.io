<p>A fire alarm is a fire safety device that is utilised to alert the public about a fire outbreak. When comparing video at the same angle of view (zoom length), higher resolution video provides facial detail farther away when using digital zoom for magnification.

Nest Secure makes our list of best home alarm systems partially due to all the neat gadgets that come along with it. While it's definitely not the least expensive of the DIY installation home security options, at $399 there's a reason why the starter kit is listed at that price.</p>

By linking them with police control room, on the event of robbery or theft, the alarm will self-operate and send a message to the nearby PCR vans.</p>
