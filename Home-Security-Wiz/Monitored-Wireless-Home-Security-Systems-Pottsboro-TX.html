<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness.

A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>

Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>

The development of web-based intruder alarm systems from the evolution of the new APIs, and from the new languages based on the web 2.0 philosophy are now giving better ways and tools to design intruder alarm systems and to increase security - the road ahead to follow.</p>
