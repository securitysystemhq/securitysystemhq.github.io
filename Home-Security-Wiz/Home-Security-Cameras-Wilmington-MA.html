All alarm systems have a control panel but this panel and the associated keypad may not always be located in an accessible area.</p>
<p>The Workplace Chapter of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (the General Application Regulations) has detailed fire safety requirements, e.g. Regulation 11 Doors and gates, Regulation 12 Emergency routes and exits, Regulation 13 Fire detection and fire fighting and Regulation 25 Employees with disabilities.

These devices have a lower price than the wireless systems, and since they are wired, you don't have to worry about batteries to power the system.</p>
