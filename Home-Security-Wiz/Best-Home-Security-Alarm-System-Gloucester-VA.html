<p>When choosing a video surveillance system, you want to go with the best video quality for the buck, and with a Network IP camera, there are 10 reasons why you should consider them over 20th century CCTV cameras. However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan. Dome cameras are typically used for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The central module connects at the Internet via WiFi and through an application we can remotely monitor the state of the house or control various devices within the enclosure.

When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered.
