<p>Is there any place in your plant which is not suitable for a person to stay there to monitor important process? There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
<p>Analogue signals can also be converted into a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings In that case the analogue video camera must be plugged directly into a video capture card in the computer, and the card then converts the analogue signal to digital.

<p>Video: Big security operation centers where a lot of cameras must be examined or scrutinized, video wall viewing is generally preferred. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. Monitored home security systems cost between $20 and $60 per month.
