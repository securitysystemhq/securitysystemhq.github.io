<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>We offer comprehensive support for complete fire protection, testing and inspecting detection and alarm as well as sprinkler and hydrant systems.

If you want more peace of mind that a problem at your home will be dealt with quickly, you could consider a burglar alarm with a monitoring contract - 38% of the people we spoke pay for one of these.</p>
<p>In such cases, the only option remains is the burglar alarm systems; these alarm systems are electronic alarms designed to alert a user from unspecific danger. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery.
