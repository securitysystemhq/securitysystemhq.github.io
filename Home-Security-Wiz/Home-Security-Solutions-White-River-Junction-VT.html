<p>Sometimes also known as CCTV or Closed Circuit Television, video surveillance systems can allow you to track and monitor anything going on inside your home whether you're there or not.

<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard drive. In addition to giving you peace of mind, a monitored home security system can reduce the chance you'll be a victim of a burglary by 300 percent and could save you up to 20 percent on your homeowners insurance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, DIY home security systems are perfect for those who don't mind rolling up their sleeves and performing some light troubleshooting if needed. Designed for unique purposes and scenarios, Hikvision's Special Series is integral to reliable network video solutions that require more than standard network cameras can offer. If you choose not to add another monthly fee to the mix, you may be disappointed with what the Nest Cam Outdoor can (and can't) do. It still delivers live video and alerts you when it detects sound or motion, but it stores those alerts for only up to three hours—and it gives just a snapshot of the action that triggered them.</p>
<p>Apart from making a siren, the burglar systems are also used to lock the doors of the car and prevent the car from being used. In most cases, the installation process will begin with connecting the cameras either to their power source or to the network. The most common alarm systems use the principle of circuits: closed and open. These are LED bulbs fitted on the camera, and switch on automatically in low light conditions and allow the camera to see in the dark in black and white images.</p>
<p>Video surveillance protects employees indirectly by monitoring each visitor who comes into the building and keeps a video record of suspicious activity. With a network camera you have an established IP address, giving you clear digital pictures with no loss of quality.

Over 80% of U.S. homes aren't protected with a security system or alarms?And according to the FBI, property crime is one area of criminal activity that continues to rise, costing Americans more than $15 billion each year.</p>
<p>In short, the proliferation of surveillance cameras has rapidly reduced our ability to maintain anonymity in public spaces; and the advent of automated face recognition and other tracking technologies only accelerate this threat to privacy. If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
