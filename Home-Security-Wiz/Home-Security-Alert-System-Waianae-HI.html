<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>

While there are some legitimate uses (nanny cams,” employee monitoring, and so on), the low cost and the ease of use means that the capability to perform surveillance by amateurs is a very real and a danger to almost anyone.</p>
