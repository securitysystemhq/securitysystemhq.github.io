<p>CCTV camera security systems are the popular equipments used for security purposes now days. That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
