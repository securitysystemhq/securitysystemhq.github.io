<p>Home security is big business both for security and alarm companies and of course the bad guys. In phase-I that is targeted for this year, South Western Railway (SWR) has recently commissioned Video Surveillance system (CCTV) at 6 major stations - Ballari by providing 33 Cameras, Belagavi with 36 Cameras, Vasco-Da Gama with 36 Cameras, Bengaluru Cantt with 21 Cameras, Bangarpet with 36 Cameras, Hassan with 36 Camera and at 3 Stations at Hassan, Shivamogga Town & Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam, work is under progress and will be commissioned shortly.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>These camera are developed with the help of excellent quality raw materials and sophisticated technology, in compliance with set industrial norms. Be alerted to movement within or around your home by motion detectors when your security system is armed. Addressable panels are usually much more advanced than their conventional counterparts, with a higher degree of programming flexibility and single point detection.</p>

Eaton's remote monitoring service, Predict Pulse, can be a life saver.</p>
<p>If you need high speed recording, opt for IP camera.

<p>When any of the security sensors are breached by an intruder, the control panel relays a message to the monitoring service or sets off your home-mounted alarm. However, you need to remind yourself that while there are outdoor cameras equipped with high tech functions and features, you only need to choose one that meets your needs, budget and lifestyle. Call points or pulls belong to manually-controlled fire alarm systems.</p>
