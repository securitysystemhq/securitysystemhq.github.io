With a CCTV camera, you loose image quality every time you transfer the video from the analog signal when it is digitized in the cameras Digital Signal Processor, which is then converted back to analog to run up the coax cable, which is again digitized at the DVR for recording.</p>
<h2>Best Home Security Companies Fallbrook California</h2>
<p>The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future. Additionally, what could be controlled through a smart phone app and whether there were false alarms and fast response times were deemed important as well.</p>
<p>The internet protocol (IP) based structure of the new surveillance systems takes into consideration versatility, adaptability, and digital security. Our video software integrates easily with your existing hardware, legacy systems and the rest of your network environment. Whilst real cameras are sited to capture evidential images, dummy cameras could be positioned in locations that offenders are likely to notice first.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

<p>Depending upon whether IP camera or analog video camera is used, the captured video can be transmitted over cables or through the air.
