<p>Of the many types of burglar alarm, one of the biggest defining factors for a system is whether the alarm is wired or wireless.

When it comes to home security systems, one of the benefits is the ability to watch the footage again later in the case of a break in.

<p>If you're only concerned with protection against home intruders, for instance, you don't need a home burglar alarm which will also let you notify the fire department incase of a home fire or emergency services for help following an accident or health emergency. The advantage of conventional systems is that they are relatively simple for small to intermediate size buildings.

<p>If the door or a window was opened and the electric circuit closed, the sudden flow of current caused one of the attached magnets in the system to vibrate. Other output functions include shutting down electrical equipment such as computers, shutting off air handling fans to prevent smoke migration, and shutting down operations such as chemical movement through piping in the alarmed area.
