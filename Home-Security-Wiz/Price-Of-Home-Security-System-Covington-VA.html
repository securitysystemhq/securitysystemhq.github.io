<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time.

It means that the closed door breaks the circuit, and if the door opens the circuit is completed and energy flows and sounds the alarm.</p>
<p>Wired alarm systems use a low-voltage current that flows between two points throughout the home's entry points, and breaking the circuit will result in the alarm being triggered; wireless alarm systems use built-in radio frequency transmitters where the signal is transmitted to the control panel and the alarm is activated. There are major differences between a burglar alarm and a home security system; the latter provides additional benefits to help protect you and your family, and it may be the better investment.</p>
