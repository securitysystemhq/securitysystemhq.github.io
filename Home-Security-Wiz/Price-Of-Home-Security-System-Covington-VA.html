<p>Wired alarm systems use a low-voltage current that flows between two points throughout the home's entry points, and breaking the circuit will result in the alarm being triggered; wireless alarm systems use built-in radio frequency transmitters where the signal is transmitted to the control panel and the alarm is activated. There are major differences between a burglar alarm and a home security system; the latter provides additional benefits to help protect you and your family, and it may be the better investment.</p>
