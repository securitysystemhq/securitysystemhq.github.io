With the rate of how quickly technology improves in today's age, analog cameras are still very capable of delivering the convenience, safety, and security that consumers have come to expect at a lower cost than IP. The new MV22X and MV72X have all the same great features as the rest of the MV smart camera family - wireless, built in analytics with machine learning - with twice the storage capacity.</p>
