<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>In addition, any attempt to force entry that is detected is forwarded to an alarm control panel, which then reliably sets off a loud alarm and the offender is forced to escape. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
<p>We should have surveillance cameras in public places because they ensure public safety. Depending on your insurance, you may qualify for as much as 15% off your premium.² When you're looking for the best home security system to buy, be sure to verify that you'll get a certificate to submit to your home insurance company after installation. Even better, you can go hybrid and opt for full-on professional monitoring with DIY installation (think Frontpoint , Protect America , or Link Interactive ). This can save you money and give you the satisfaction of upgrading your home's security with your own two hands.</p>
