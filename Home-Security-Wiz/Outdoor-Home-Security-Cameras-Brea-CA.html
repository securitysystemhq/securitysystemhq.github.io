<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>This kit is a superb value way to invest in a home security system and experiment with smart home.
