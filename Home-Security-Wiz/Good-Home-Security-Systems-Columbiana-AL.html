<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera.

The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
