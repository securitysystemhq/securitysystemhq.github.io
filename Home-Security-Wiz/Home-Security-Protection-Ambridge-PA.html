We install a simple remote monitoring system at site which has 3G wireless communication function and image transmission function, and enable the wireless data transmission and the visual monitoring through the camera images.</p>
<p>The Multi-sensor detectors combine inputs from both optical and heat sensors and process them using a sophisticated algorithm built into the detector circuitry.
