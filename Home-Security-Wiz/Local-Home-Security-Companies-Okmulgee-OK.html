<p>The most basic burglar alarm systems monitor the perimeter of a home or building for breaches, such as opening a door or breaking a window. We all know that a fire alarm is used to detect smoke or heat - in the form of fire - and alert us to the danger so that we may vacate the presences in enough time to secure our safety.
