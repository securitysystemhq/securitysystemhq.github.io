<p>Having a CCTV camera installed in your residential and commercial areas is not a new thing. Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them â€” from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>

<p>This is a kind of artificial intelligence that is called "video analytics", and is potentially beneficial for efficient use of surveillance cameras, but this technology has sometimes been significantly oversold by the surveillance camera industry. But, according to security experts, pound-for-pound, having a monitored home alarm security system, which they strongly emphasize MUST be a good and reliable brand, is perhaps the best and SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION that one could institute in having a home that scares away potential burglars and keeps them away from your home, and your family safety.</p>

<h3>5 Reasons To Install a Video Security Camera System At Your Home in Great Barrington</h3>
<p>The very best surveillance systems are built on excellence in video security and data management. If the area is light, constantly changing, the camera auto iris lens is needed to produce the best images. Larger systems provide sensors, lights, and cameras that cover an entire home. When choosing a video surveillance system, consider what areas you want to monitor and the field of coverage you need in each area.</p>
<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
<p>The technical specifics may be slightly different for each security provider, but the basics of alarm monitoring is similar in any home security system. HSI offer a range of Fibreglass poles for testing detectors at height designed to be used with the Enclosed Delivery System or Heat Testing equipment. An Annunciator is a remote device that provides information about the location of the alarms. Advantages: Very reliable sensors, low false alarm rate, and midpriced.</p>
