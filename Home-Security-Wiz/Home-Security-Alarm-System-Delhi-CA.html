<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

The HHL centre can also be connected to other systems: lighting control, door locking, video monitoring, access control and lift, gate and beam control. The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing—during the day and at night—with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.</p>
<p>The sensors are typically placed in doors that lead to and from a house as well as easily accessible windows, particularly any that open, especially those at ground level. Smoke information classification solves the problem of low accuracy of traditional smoke alarms. Some dummy cameras do have added features such as a cable that can be fitted into a conduit to make it look even more real and I do think this is a good idea.</p>
