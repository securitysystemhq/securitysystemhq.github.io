<p>Having a CCTV camera installed in your residential and commercial areas is not a new thing. Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them — from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>
