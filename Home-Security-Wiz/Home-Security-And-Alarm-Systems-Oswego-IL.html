<p>The company wanted to create a comprehensive security device without using wi-fi-connected cameras, which are controversial but increasingly common thanks to product families like the Google-owned Nest and Amazon's Ring. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<h3>The Advancement of Social Security Technology with Network Security in Oswego</h3>
<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard drive. In addition to giving you peace of mind, a monitored home security system can reduce the chance you'll be a victim of a burglary by 300 percent and could save you up to 20 percent on your homeowners insurance.</p>
<p>Typically, a 32GB microSD card store up to 2 weeks of recording; but it also depends on the video quality; lower quality videos take less space but high-quality videos take more space.

Many in the CCTV industry claim that many analog cameras can outperform network cameras at a lower price. It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space.</p>
