<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use.

You might want to consider a traditional burglar alarm system; this will give you sensors on your doors and windows, and alert you to any intruders. Look for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision. However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>
