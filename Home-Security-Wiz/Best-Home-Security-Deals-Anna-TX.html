<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>

Moreover, cameras can be placed in areas that require security such as parking spots, VIP areas, schools, restaurants & hotels, bank locker rooms, hospitals, etc.</p>
<h2>Home Security System Alarm Anna Texas</h2>
<p>To further explain this, assume that a building's fire alarm system has 5 circuits, zones A through E, and that each circuit has 10 smoke detectors and 2 manual stations located in various rooms of each zone. The standard size is 380 TVL to 420 TVL cameras high quality up to 480 TVL to 570 TVL. Few do-it-yourself wired systems contain movement detectors, but they can usually be added as an extra. Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>

We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
