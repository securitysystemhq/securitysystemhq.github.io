<p>Burglar alarms were usually associated with stores or other businesses in the past, but over the past few years, more and more people chose to protect their homes with alarms as well. When installing wireless security cameras, keep in mind that the smart home camera you buy will only be as good as the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the location where you plan to install it. So before you drill holes in your walls or otherwise mess up your doorframe, brick or siding, check your Wi-Fi speed If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll notice significant lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other delays that make security cameras a pain to use.</p>

Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>
<p>Smart home automation features for a more robust security system. Fire-alarm control panels (FACP) or fire-alarm control units (FACU) consist of electric panels that function as the controlling components of a fire-alarm system Figure 9.35). On the contrary, some security camera providers offer cloud storage monthly plans to securely store videos on the cloud. Alert systems can also close fire doors, recall elevators, and interface and monitor the installed suppression systems, such as sprinklers.</p>

You might want to consider a traditional burglar alarm system; this will give you sensors on your doors and windows, and alert you to any intruders.

However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. Choosing the right security system for your property and budget is no easy task - there's a broad range of systems available and you are entering into a world filled with technical jargon. Hidden spy cameras can usually be set by the DVR for motion detection to save recording space.
