<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>

<p>You can opt for wired burglar alarm systems or can choose to have battery operated models for installation. Although, this is not an easy task, the experiments in this chapter show that, contrary to traditional detectors, video processing techniques can not only improve and accelerate the detection but also provide the analysis and the forecast of the fire.
