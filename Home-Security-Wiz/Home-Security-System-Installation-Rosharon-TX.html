<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>DC Power Splitter - 1 to 2 Y Cable This DC Power Adapter Y Cable Pigtail splits 1 power signal into 2 and is useful for powering multiple cameras from one central adapter.

<p>Statistically, approximately 61% of all sprinkler controlled fires are stopped by two or less sprinklers. This is the safest and simplest intention of a security alarm system.

Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>
<p>Fire protection systems are complex safety systems, which must be absolutely reliable in case of emergency. The fire alarm panel activates the flashers or the sounders, turns on sprinklers (or they can be activated along with the detector), or makes a call to the authorities or to the occupants.
