<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>

<p>Fire alarms shorten your recovery time: Less building damage means shorter downtime until you can reopen for business. Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. In some cases, people will mount signs in their front yards alerting potential intruders that surveillance cameras are in operation.
