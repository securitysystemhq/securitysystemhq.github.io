<p>Have you ever noticed that your fire alarm or your smoke alarm goes off every time you cook? We constantly push the boundaries of technology to develop intelligent solutions that go beyond the highest security demands of today and deliver clear business advantages beyond security. In this case individual plug in power supplies are used to power them with power cable running as separate and independent line to the camera. Some of the lower-quality home security systems come with only basic door and window sensors that customers can easily install themselves.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety.

The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm.
