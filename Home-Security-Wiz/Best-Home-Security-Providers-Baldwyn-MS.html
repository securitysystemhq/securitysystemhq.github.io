Directly attached storage are the hard drives that are located outside of the digital video recorder, network video recorder or server. Some providers have motion sensors that are designed to be pet-friendly, avoiding pets under 80 pounds to help prevent false alarms. Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>

<p>Therefore, any changes made in the picture settings on the NVR must be communicated back to the IP security camera.
