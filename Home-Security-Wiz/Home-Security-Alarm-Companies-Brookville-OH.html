Over the past few years there has been an upward trend in terms of migration to HD cctv camera surveillance. Thanks for sharing this great article About Cameras, my opinion is every person should Buy IP Camera because advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at.

The input from an analog camera is encoded and output a digital stream for transmission over an IP network. The alarm itself is wired in low-voltage cable, but the control panel usually needs a connection to mains electricity via a fused connection unit.
