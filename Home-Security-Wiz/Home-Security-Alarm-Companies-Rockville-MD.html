<p>This is the foundation of any interactive monitoring home security system. CCTV is also known as Video Surveillance system. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating ‘Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.

However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>
