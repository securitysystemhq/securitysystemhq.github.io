<p>When you're looking for the best alarms and home security systems, these resources and tips will help you protect your home. A:There could be two situations in which a burglar alarm might be causing this nuisance: The volume is too high, or the neighbor's alarm went off and no one is doing anything about it.

There are major differences between a burglar alarm and a home security system; the latter provides additional benefits to help protect you and your family, and it may be the better investment.</p>
