Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered.

<p>IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it.
