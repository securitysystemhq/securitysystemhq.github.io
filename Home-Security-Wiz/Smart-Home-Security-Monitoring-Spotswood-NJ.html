Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first.

<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself.
