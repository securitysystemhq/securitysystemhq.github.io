<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

<h4>Alarm Security System Companies Buxton 04093</h4>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted. Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>
<p>Touch sensor and Motion detector is connected to security phase microcontroller whereas temperature and humidity sensor and Flame sensor is connected to NodeMCU ESP8266 directly. Perhaps the best feature of the Nest equipment is the Nest Guard, a user friendly control panel that you use to arm and disarm your system and comes compatible with Google Assistant (Google is Nest's parent company).
