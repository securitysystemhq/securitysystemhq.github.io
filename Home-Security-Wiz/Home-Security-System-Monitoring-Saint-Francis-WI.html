<p>Many cities, businesses, and individuals have installed Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras for surveillance purposes. The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness. An annual fee is charged for alarm monitoring, this is typically paid directly to the alarm company. All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios. A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>In this article, we have learned that Fire Alarm systems are fitted in many buildings we encounter every day and that they are used to warn people within the building of an emergency fire-related situation.

<p>A wired camera has a video cable that transmits the video signal from the camera to a recording or viewing device. The detectors in a zone (or area) of the building are all connected to the same pair of wires. We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation.
