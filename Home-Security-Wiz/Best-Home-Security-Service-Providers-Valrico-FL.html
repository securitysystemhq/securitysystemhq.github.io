<p>Conventional or "point wired" fire detection and alarm systems were for many years the standard method for providing emergency signaling. A:There are different types of devices available in a home surveillance system, including CCTV camera, cables, power supply and video monitors.

For an extra level of security, video surveillance can be incorporated into your burglar alarm system. It is acceptable to have 7-15 fps for recorded files in many applications, but technology in DVR systems has pushed real-time video for the masses and 30 fps recording will soon be the standard recording rates across all channels as available today.</p>
<p>DVR is a combination of software, hardware, and video storage. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. Accordingly, the full form of CCTV cameras is closed-circuit television cameras. Retail establishments use video surveillance to monitor customer transactions.
