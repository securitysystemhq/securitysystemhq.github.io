<p>Recently, people have used smoke alarms which only have one sensor to detect fire. In February, Edinburgh, Scotland-based Current Health (formerly snap40) received FDA clearance for clinical use of its artificial intelligence-enabled device and platform for remote patient monitoring in the hospital. If you can link all your smart home devices into a voice control unit, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, then that's even better.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
<p>Repeated false alarms and you risk being removed from the police list. IP can optionally be transmitted across the public internet, allowing users to view their cameras remotely on a computer or phone via an internet connection. The AVIOTEC series detects flames and smoke at the source and thus, provides reliable fire detection within seconds, especially in environments with high ceilings.
