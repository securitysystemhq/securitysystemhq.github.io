If you can link all your smart home devices into a voice control unit, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, then that's even better.</p>
<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. In these systems, the monitor to be viewed will often be automatically shifted to a larger screen and will activate recording equipment.</p>

Reviewers also praised the ease of use of the key fobs and the ability to disable individual sensors, so you can do things like step out of the back door without setting off the alarm, while still being alerted if someone tries to break down the front door.</p>
<p>In short, the proliferation of surveillance cameras has rapidly reduced our ability to maintain anonymity in public spaces; and the advent of automated face recognition and other tracking technologies only accelerate this threat to privacy. If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
