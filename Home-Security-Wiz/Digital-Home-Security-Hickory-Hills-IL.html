<p>Strategically placed cameras could mean would-be burglars bypass your business for an easier target. This is as simple as it sounds, wired burglar alarm systems mean that all the connecting component parts need to be wired together to complete the electrical circuit. The security systems run from $500,000 per district for an analog system consisting of CCTV (closed circuit television) monitors to million-dollar IP-based systems with digital surveillance cameras connected to a web network.</p>
<p>Complete, high-quality audio systems to improve security, make live or scheduled announcements, or create ambience with great-sounding background music.

<p>We also found it easy to set up, scalable to small and large homes, and configurable with a variety of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors.

Not that long ago, the only folks that could afford security cameras were James Bond, NASA and the police.</p>
<p>Currently, many buses in a city have installed High-Definition (HD) camera systems to monitor in bus conditions. Wireless IP cameras have the capability to record to a SD card when the camera is motion activated. STMicroelectronics provides system level know-how and offers a complete set of semiconductor products to implement any smart alarm devices, thanks to complete range of precise sensors, ultra-low power solutions also for wireless connectivity, optimizing and drastically reducing energy consumption.</p>
<p>Wired cameras are the standard for this technology. Make sure your fire detection, protection and extinguishing systems function properly before or when fire breaks out.
