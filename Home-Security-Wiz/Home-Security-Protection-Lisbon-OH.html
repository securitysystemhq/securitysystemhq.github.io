<p>Surveillance plays a huge part in today's society, and with cameras all around us, our day-to-day lives are experiencing higher levels of security each day. Your job is not done, however, after you buy and install smoke detectors. It is during the testing of your alarm system you will see if any problems have occurred in relation to the burglar alarm battery. Dialler burglar alarms automatically dial your phone number, or that of nominated friends and family, when the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded.

What this means is that the camera can be powered and transfer video feed all with one Cat5 cable, rather than running a power cable and a separate video cable the way that analog cameras do.

<p>Here's a look at the top home security systems for overall customer satisfaction.

<p>Although MoneySuperMarket's research shows insurance premiums rise by as much as 16% after a burglary, it is unlikely that any insurer discount will cover the costs of the annual maintenance and monitoring for the alarm, let alone the installation costs. If you want to keep an eye on a dark area, hidden video cameras can be bought with night vision capability. The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station.</p>
