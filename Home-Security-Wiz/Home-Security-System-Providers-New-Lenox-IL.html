You need to purchase a base station in addition to the camera, which makes the up-front cost more hefty than other cameras.

Wireless cameras are easy to install and re-position, but you'll want to check the battery levels periodically to ensure they're fully powered.</p>

Wireless cameras don't require the installation of lengthy cords to a recording device.</p>

<p>With budget challenges and the inability to put more officers on the street, cameras become the eyes” of the City and are a cost effective way to improve public safety in the City.

The reason behind this is that, many burglars when enter any house they first search for the main switch and close the circuit.</p>
<p>Video surveillance serves as the remote eyes for management and the security force.
