IP camera, is a kind of computerized camcorder usually utilized for reconnaissance and which, is not like simple shut circuit TV (CCTV) cameras, can send and get information by means of a PC network and the Internet. Box surveillance camera is an ultra-high-resolution CCTV camera made with the new image sensor processor which is capable of capturing video at 700 TV lines of resolution in color and black & white, 960H CCTV resolution.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
