In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>A recent poll found that many physicians and patients are interested in employing remote monitoring technologies, although some respondents still expressed concerns about data security. Most outdoor cameras are fairly easy to install but you might need to call in an electrician. If you are worried that your home can be robbed, it is a good idea to go for a combination intruder and fire monitoring service.
