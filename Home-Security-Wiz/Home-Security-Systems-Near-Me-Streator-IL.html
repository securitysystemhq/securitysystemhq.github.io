<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>In addition, any attempt to force entry that is detected is forwarded to an alarm control panel, which then reliably sets off a loud alarm and the offender is forced to escape. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>

Another object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric detection system which is selfcompensating in that changes of ambient light, such as daylight or artificial illumination, will not cause the system to give an alarm and which cannot be defeated by using a flash-light or some other form of light source. The San Diego Police Department hoped to gain access to footage from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego” surveillance program As of 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility problems, and officers had difficulty viewing footage in real time because the department's police cruisers did not have a 4G connection.</p>

<p>On the surface, surveillance cameras and security cameras have a lot in common. This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems. But the police say it must be as part of a suite of prevention measures because a burglar alarm on its own will not prevent entry to your home”.</p>
