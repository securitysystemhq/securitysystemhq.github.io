<p>Many people share a grave misconception about the use and application of fire alarm systems. This security camera is pretty generic and provides a decent quality of about 720p resolution. Closed circuit television is one of the most effective and commonly used types of video surveillance available on the market, but is a step above in price from wireless cameras. It's great value for the money, and you can even try it for free for 15 days to see if you like the equipment, monitoring, and service.

A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. While wireless home security systems are popular and known for an easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more reliable because they aren't subject to interference.</p>
