<p>The police recommend home owners install a visual burglar alarm” with a box on the outside of the house. In a third form of photoelectric detection system that may be termed a pulse system, changes in the amount of radiation of either visible or invisible light will cause an alarm by tripping a vacuum tube. At the same time, the digital display will be lighted and the alarm place will be watched.
