<p>Advanced motion sensors include reliance on photo-sensory detection (say, a burglar walking into a beam of light from a light sensor source and breaks the path of the beam to trigger the alarm). With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters.
