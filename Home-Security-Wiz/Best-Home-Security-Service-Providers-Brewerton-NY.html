<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make. The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>
<p>Stream your home cameras through your phone, arm your alarm system, and control all of your home devices from the same app. Abode also offers a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensor and one motion detector. They usually work on two principles: heat detection and smoke detection. By linking them with police control room, on the event of robbery or theft, the alarm will self-operate and send a message to the nearby PCR vans.</p>
<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely. They are great for those in rented accommodation as they can be removed just as easily as they were installed so when you move on to your new home, you can take the alarm system with you. Fire alarms reduce property loss: While strobe lights and sirens don't actively put out fires, they alert the people who can.</p>

Look for models with multiple sensors - motion and heat for instance - that helps to reduce the number of false alerts.

Panoramic security cameras, also known as 360-degree cameras, face in all directions and can be a great forensic tool.
