In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

Hard drives that are built inside a digital video recorder, network video recorder or server represents the internal storage. When it comes to the overall safety and security of your business, video surveillance and security cameras are a must.</p>
<p>Ask the home security company for an itemized breakdown of all charges, which may include equipment costs, installation fees, monthly monitoring charges and more. The Digital Video Recorder also known as a DVR is used to take footage or video taken by a security camera and storing it as the name says, digitally, onto a hard drive. The camera uses a number of sensors to detect the presence of a person in the room and monitor their activities.</p>
