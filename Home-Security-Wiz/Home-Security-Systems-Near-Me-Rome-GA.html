It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

This feature allows you to disable the interior motion sensors but leaves the perimeter sensors active for the best in home security. DVRs generally offer what is known as D1 resolution, which is the traditional video quality used in closed-circuit television systems.</p>
