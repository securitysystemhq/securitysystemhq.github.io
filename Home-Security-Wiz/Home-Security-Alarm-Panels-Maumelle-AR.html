<p>Prior to fire alarms, smoke detectors were primarily the main indicator for alerting the occupants of a building to a fire. Without a plan, you'll still get a quality camera with a great viewing angle. It is best if you use a local company because they are often more in-tune with what is happening in your specific area and some even offer discount fees to local residents taking up their monitoring service. DVRs come in 4, 8, 9, and 16 channel increments and this selection is critical because adding cameras above the DVR channels available will require an additional DVR, not just additional channels.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>Digital Video Recorders accepts only analog camera feeds as inputs and supports remote viewing over the Internet. So whether you choose a DIY home security system or opt for the traditional route, a home alarm system is a smart investment. Here's our 2018 video surveillance buyer's guide to help break down the component parts of video surveillance systems. Here's a list of just some of the home alarm systems providers Fort Knox® can upgrade & monitor: ADT, Honeywell, Xfinity, Ademco, DSC, Go Control, GE Security, AT&T Digital Life, First Alert, Interlogix, and Napco.</p>
