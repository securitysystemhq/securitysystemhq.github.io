Panoramic security cameras, also known as 360-degree cameras, face in all directions and can be a great forensic tool. When smoke particles pass thru the chamber of the optical detector, it scatters light that triggers the alarm.

It's never an easy task to evacuate people from really large buildings, even with the latest in fire alarm design.
