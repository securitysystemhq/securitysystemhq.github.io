<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away” or Stay” mode. Around 2016, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn't have time to watch them. A burglar alarm system is not the same thing as a complete home security system, though it may constitute a part of one.
