<p>Every now and then you may find yourself in a position where one of your security cameras has stopped working. They can perform all the functions of a digital video recorder mentioned above and adds support for IP and megapixel cameras. Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services.

These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>Home security cameras are a crucial investment in protecting your home. In addition to providing more comprehensive protection, complete home security systems that are backed by professional monitoring services may also qualify customers for discounted homeowner's insurance premiums of up to 20 percent.

Unlike a standard burglar alarm, a monitored burglar alarm will never go unheard and our alarm system can be operated and reset remotely - without the need to visit the property or disrupting the neighbours.</p>
<p>All these capabilities make alarm systems more robust, not only in terms of security but also in terms of supervision flexibility. The British Security Industry Association (BSIA) estimates that, of the approximate eight million homes with alarms, 30% are audible-only alarms - alarms that ring or have a siren but are not monitored - and just 2% are remotely monitored alarms. The H.264 codec greatly reduces the size of your digital video files without compromising video quality.</p>

When choosing a video surveillance system, consider what areas you want to monitor and the field of coverage you need in each area.</p>
<p>Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
