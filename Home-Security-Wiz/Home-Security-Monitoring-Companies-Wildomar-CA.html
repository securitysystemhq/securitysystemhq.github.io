<p>The signals that are sending by the alarm system are received by the monitoring centers and thus inform the cops to take immediate action against burglar.

<p>The most important characteristics of an effective burglar alarm system are its accuracy in identifying the correct alarm outputs to assure quick and correct responses and the unit's accuracy in communicating with the security service provider. From a practical perspective, wireless systems have more flexibility if you may move or don't want to put holes in walls.
