<h4>DVR Security Camera System Gold Canyon 85118</h4>

Activation of a burglar alarm circuit is made when the switch detects the opening or closing of the circuit, for example opening a door or window.</p>
<p>This is a simple device which will sense intrusion using wireless sensors like door magnetic sensors. The CITRUS study was very thorough and is frequently cited as evidence that surveillance cameras don't work, even though the study found significant positive effects from the cameras.
