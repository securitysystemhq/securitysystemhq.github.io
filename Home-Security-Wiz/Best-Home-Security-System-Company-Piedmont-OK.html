<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>

<p>The siren and lights will alert the householder or neighbors that someone has broken into the house and the sound will often drive the intruder to run away quickly. Magnetic contacts will cause the alarm to sound if the circuit is broken: the neatest and most effective are flush-lilting (like mortice locks); surface-mounted contacts are easier to install and may be the only option on double doors or metal-framed windows.</p>

Program Arduino to sense the data from all the three sensors and send these data to raspberry pi through serial communication. Smart Cloud Cameras from ambicam are a hassle-free option for your outdoor and indoor security needs.</p>

The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station.</p>
