<p>Burglar alarms were usually associated with stores or other businesses in the past, but over the past few years, more and more people chose to protect their homes with alarms as well. When installing wireless security cameras, keep in mind that the smart home camera you buy will only be as good as the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the location where you plan to install it. So before you drill holes in your walls or otherwise mess up your doorframe, brick or siding, check your Wi-Fi speed If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll notice significant lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other delays that make security cameras a pain to use.</p>

<p>All these sensors work in tandem with other sensors and the IP camera so that the central control device sends warnings and notifications to your smartphones. The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm.
