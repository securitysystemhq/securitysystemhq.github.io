<p>These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible. The motion detectors for indoors are suitable for stores, offices, public facilities and residential buildings, in addition to manufacturing, machine shops and garages, for example. Disadvantages: expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost), and a high rate of false alarms as it cannot distinguish some pets from humans.</p>
<p>However, some are more subtle, like the increase in demand for home medical monitoring systems. Frontpoint equipment pricing is on the low end, but its monitoring services start at a slightly higher price point than the entry-level services of its competitors.
