<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
