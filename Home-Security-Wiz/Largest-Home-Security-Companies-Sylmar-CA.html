<p>One of the most important decisions you will have to make for your office is what type of fire alarm system you choose to have installed. I dont see how these CCTV cameras will stop terrorism. Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>

<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs.
