In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Today there's a lot more to a home security camera than video surveillance. In a remote monitoring approach, combined with Risk Based Monitoring , you are moving away from 100% SDV onsite. I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>
