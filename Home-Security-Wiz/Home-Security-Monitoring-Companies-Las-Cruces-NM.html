<p>Fire alarm systems are installed in commercial and residential buildings for the sole purpose to avoid fire and smoke. Learn more about professional installation services here. Zmodo offers Zmodo Cloud Service to store, share and playback your security camera's footage. After years of development, surveillance cameras can provide higher resolution images and clearer audio. Cameras should be mounted as close possible to the field of view required, and the closer the camera to the subject the better the identification of the subject will be.

However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>You will also need to choose which installation option you prefer for your alarm system: professional or DIY. For example, if a customer claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, or that an employee was rude or provided misinformation, video surveillance records can be used to determine whether they were in the store on the day in question, and what, in fact, took place.
