<p>Broadly classified into home and business surveillance cameras, CCTV cameras come in varied styles, configurations and types. This Top 5 list has all the best products like DUMMY CCTV fake dome dummy camera with flashing light 1500B, D3D Wireless HD IP Wifi CCTV Indoor Security Camera,(White Color), Mini Wifi IP Wireless CCTV Surveillance Camera Camcorder For Android For iPhone, D3D Wireless HD IP Wifi CCTV Watch ONLINE DEMO Right Now Indoor Security Camera (Support Upto 128 GB Micro SD Card) (Black Color), HD 1080P Sport Car DVR Mini Camera SQ8 Portable Mini DV Voice Video Recorder and others at one place.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>All these sensors work in tandem with other sensors and the IP camera so that the central control device sends warnings and notifications to your smartphones. The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm. In one, New York City police in a helicopter supposedly monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared video camera on an amorous couple enjoying the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop balcony.</p>
