<p>This poses a challenge for alarming in public buildings which are visited by many different members of society. Fire-alarm systems are essential to any facility, particularly in large buildings where there may be visitors or personnel who are unfamiliar with their surroundings.

Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
<p>Efficiency of burglar alarms depends on the zone triggered, number of zones, time of the day and other aspects installed within the monitoring system.
