<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>Bells-only alarms make a noise, but don't contact anyone (such as the police or you).

<p>The sensors are typically placed in doors that lead to and from a house as well as easily accessible windows, particularly any that open, especially those at ground level. Smoke information classification solves the problem of low accuracy of traditional smoke alarms. Some dummy cameras do have added features such as a cable that can be fitted into a conduit to make it look even more real and I do think this is a good idea.</p>
