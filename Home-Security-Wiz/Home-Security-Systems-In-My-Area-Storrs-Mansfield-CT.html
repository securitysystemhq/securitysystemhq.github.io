<p>You can't power your CCTV camera over your Ethernet network, and this is beneficial because you don't need a power outlet to power a network camera. Past statistics on crimes show that the more noticeable and better technology the camera systems are, the more it helps in preventing criminal activities in business or residential buildings 6 Factors that are necessary for an outdoor camera are: they should be weather- resistant, and should include night vision even in well-lit locations.</p>
<p>However, the supplied 10-foot power cord limits placement and isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a Nest), and notifications that distinguish between people and general motion will cost you an additional $10 per month. You should also make sure that your local police department accepts the burglar alarm. A substantial amount of time can be saved during investigation and prosecution by using evidence from security camera footage.</p>
