The thermal imaging technology has drastically evolved since then, and thermal imaging cameras have evolved to become compact in size and look like a digital photo camera, they are now easy to use and produce real-time crisp high-resolution images making them a widely important tool for industrial applications 8 They can detect anomalies that are generally invisible to the naked human eye, thus taking corrective preventing costly systems going for a total breakdown.</p>
<p>We offer comprehensive support for complete fire protection, testing and inspecting detection and alarm as well as sprinkler and hydrant systems.
