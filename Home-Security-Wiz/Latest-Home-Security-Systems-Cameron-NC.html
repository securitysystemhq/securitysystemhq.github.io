Customer can view the live feed from door stations and any connected cameras while storing messages and captured images. Protect your property with a variety of intruder alarms, surveillance equipment, sensors and controlled entry systems. Leveraging on our quality oriented professionals, we are offering Wired Fire Alarm Control Panel to our clients. Digital CCTV cameras range from compact cameras, fixed cameras to direction-controlled ones that can distinguish objects in the dark under different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
<p>You will also need to choose which installation option you prefer for your alarm system: professional or DIY. For example, if a customer claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, or that an employee was rude or provided misinformation, video surveillance records can be used to determine whether they were in the store on the day in question, and what, in fact, took place. SiteService remotely connects to any AK SC 255, AK SC 355, or AK SM 800 series Danfoss control system and gives you a full visualization of live plant status, alarm management, system performance history, and component settings.</p>
