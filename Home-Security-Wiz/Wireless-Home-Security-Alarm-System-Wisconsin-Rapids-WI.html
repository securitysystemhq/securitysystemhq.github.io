<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>The choice is really up to you, but seeing how the alarm is a key component in any home security system, you should try to spend more here instead of on less practical components such as motion detectors and the likes. Remote Monitoring Service guarantees notification of any issues that may become significant through a personal customer call. Get in touch with us for an industry-leading combination of high-stech software and efficient remote monitoring services.</p>

When selecting cameras for a CCTV system we have many choices, and most of them have specific uses for specific conditions. The best smoke alarms can detect smoke particles, flames, and carbon monoxide. You must have, if not extensive, atleast a decent knowledge about the types and functioning of burglar alarms before you decide to buy one that suits you.</p>
<p>If the fire alarm system is addressable, the source of the occurrence will be pointed on the control panel. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Today, due to different technological advancements, video surveillance cameras are better than ever and can now be used with computers for more complex situations.</p>

<p>This kit comes with a base station, 1-keypad, 5-contact sensors, 2-motion detectors, and a range extender. The EU's Data Protection Directive regulates access to personal data including CCTV recordings. For example the cost savings associated with crimes averted through camera systems in a city of USA saved over four dollars for every dollar spent on the technology, while another city yielded a 50 cent return on the dollar.</p>
