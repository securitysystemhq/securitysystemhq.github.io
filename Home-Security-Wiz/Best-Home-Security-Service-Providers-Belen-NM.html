<p>Depending on your requirements you can go with any home security system through which you can monitor the security or maybe if not interested in getting the whole system there are ample individual devices available that let you check your home via mobile or your smart devices. If our main pick is not available or you just want basic coverage without having to subscribe to a service, the Logitech Circle 2 is an excellent alternative that includes 24 hours of free cloud storage (with an option to purchase more ).

This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
