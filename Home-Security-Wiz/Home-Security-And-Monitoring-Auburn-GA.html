We start with solutions from the leading burglar alarm system manufacturers, then apply our expertise to the challenge of integrating the best burglar alarms, wireless systems options, and remote management tools.

All Speed Dome Series Thermal Cameras integrate thermal modules and optical modules together.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring technologies have also become something of a focus for the tech device industry. The standard does not require the use of heat detectors as part of the basic protection scheme, but it recommends that heat detectors be used to supplement the basic smoke detector system. Add cameras to a network before they even arrive, and adjust both optical and software settings remotely.
