A building fire emergency notification system consisting of audible and visual alarm notification appliances installed within all common-use areas of a building, manual alarm stations installed at every exit from every level, and automatic initiating devices (i.e., smoke detectors, heat detectors, or flame detectors) installed throughout all areas of the building.</p>
<p>For this reason, most fire alarm systems are designed with one or more manual alarm activation devices to be used by the person who discovers a fire. The Pan Tilt and Zoom Cameras (PTZ) can be remotely controlled to pan (left or right), tilt (up and down) or zoom in to an object or revert back to wide-angle for a larger field of view.

Past statistics on crimes show that the more noticeable and better technology the camera systems are, the more it helps in preventing criminal activities in business or residential buildings 6 Factors that are necessary for an outdoor camera are: they should be weather- resistant, and should include night vision even in well-lit locations.</p>
<p>The Multi-sensor detectors combine inputs from both optical and heat sensors and process them using a sophisticated algorithm built into the detector circuitry. When one of these initiating devices is triggered, the control panel will go into an alarm state.
