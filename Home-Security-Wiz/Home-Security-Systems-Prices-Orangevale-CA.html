If your alarm is set and your home security is breached your alarm system will automatically and immediately send a distress signal to the monitoring company.</p>
<p>Once the system detects intrusion, the house security system will send a sign either to the local police or to the monitoring company.

Actually, the wireless CCTV camera type only sends data wirelessly and it still needs a cable for power supply, which set it apart from the truly wire-free CCTV camera types.
