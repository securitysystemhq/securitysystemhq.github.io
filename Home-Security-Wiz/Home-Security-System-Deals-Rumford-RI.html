<p>The addition of VIP significantly improves the usefulness of CCTV , particularly where there are a large number of cameras installed, which an operator cannot view at the same time. The control panel's microprocessor sends a constant interrogation signal over each circuit, in which each initiating device is contacted to inquire its status (normal or emergency). Plus prior to you actually testing the system you need to walk round the house to make sure that all doors and windows are closed.</p>
<p>The most important characteristics of an effective burglar alarm system are its accuracy in identifying the correct alarm outputs to assure quick and correct responses and the unit's accuracy in communicating with the security service provider. From a practical perspective, wireless systems have more flexibility if you may move or don't want to put holes in walls.
