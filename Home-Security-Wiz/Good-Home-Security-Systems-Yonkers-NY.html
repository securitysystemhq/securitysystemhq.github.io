<p>Burglar alarms were usually associated with stores or other businesses in the past, but over the past few years, more and more people chose to protect their homes with alarms as well. When installing wireless security cameras, keep in mind that the smart home camera you buy will only be as good as the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the location where you plan to install it.
