Cameras with two-way communication have a mic that picks up sound near the camera, plus a speaker that lets you interact with people or pets on the other end. The installation is usually a one time fee, after that you will be paying a monthly fee for monitoring. Installing alarm system also becomes confusing sometimes.</p>
