Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

The San Diego Police Department hoped to gain access to footage from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego” surveillance program As of 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility problems, and officers had difficulty viewing footage in real time because the department's police cruisers did not have a 4G connection.</p>
