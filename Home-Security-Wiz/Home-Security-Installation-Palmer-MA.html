Active and faster response - You may have the best home security measures in your house, but if the kind of security system you have fails to get quick response from the outside or from third party monitoring such as quick connection to fire departments, law enforcements and other authorities, your system is useless and may need some major overhaul, or if not, a complete replacement.</p>
<p>The CONNECT (Clinical Evaluation of Remote Notification to Reduce Time to Clinical Decision) trial: the value of wireless remote monitoring with automatic clinician alerts. Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Security alarms are a helpful deterrent to ward off potential intruders but, although these clever bits of kits may be helping to fend off con artists, they can be known to be ‘trigger happy' over what constitutes a break-in.
