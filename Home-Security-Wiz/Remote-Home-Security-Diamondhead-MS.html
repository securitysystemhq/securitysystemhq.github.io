<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>The cameras perform different functions depending on the type of surveillance system being used. They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it.
