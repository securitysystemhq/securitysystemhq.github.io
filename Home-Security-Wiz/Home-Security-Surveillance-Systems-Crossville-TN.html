<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>

The operators observing the test could not believe it was night-time when viewing the camera. The company will find it difficult if not impossible to monitor the security systems when all of their equipment and employees are sitting in the dark.

<p>Furthermore, the reduction in the cost of an IP camera has enabled end users to shift from traditional analog systems to IP-based systems for video surveillance. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control via iOS and Android smartphone apps, push and email alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for unlimited cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro , which is available separately.
