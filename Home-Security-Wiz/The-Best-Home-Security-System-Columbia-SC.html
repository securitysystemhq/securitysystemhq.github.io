<p>Motion activated cameras with DVR's are an excellent solution if you need to monitor a specific area or location such as a parking lot or parking garage.

<p>These include sensors, smoke alarms, key fobs, panic buttons and hi-res cameras. Most security companies, whether they're DIY, professionally installed, professionally monitored, or self-monitored, will offer guidance if you're confused about what to choose.
