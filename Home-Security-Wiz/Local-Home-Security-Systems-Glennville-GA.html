<p>Practically all buildings and a lot of homes these days have fire alarm systems.

Gone are the days when only business owners relied on monitoring systems to protect their property. A wireless burglar alarm system can be easily expanded to include additional motion sensors and other peripherals (smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, driveway and pool sensors, motion activated lights, etc.).

<p>Professional monitoring - Many DIY home security providers don't offer professional monitoring to watch over your home at all times. The most popular fixed temperature detectors used in homes are preset to sound an alarm when the temperature exceeds 135 degrees F.

These detectors may be used in an attic where summer temperatures normally may reach 135 degrees F.</p>
