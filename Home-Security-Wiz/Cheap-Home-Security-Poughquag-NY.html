<p>Be that as it may, cameras are only one a player in the general surveillance system, and regardless of whether an ever-increasing number of cameras and video encoders are incorporated, progressed and complex picture examination is still performed on the backend, regularly using cloud-based preparing administrations. These cameras can pick up coloured images in very low-light conditions. Each version of the FMZ 5000 can be used as a strict fire detection control panel or, combined, as fire detection and extinguishing control panel for water and gas-based extinguishing systems; as a spark detection and spark extinguishing control panel and for all other applications involving instantaneous fire protection, such as machine protection or painting systems.</p>
