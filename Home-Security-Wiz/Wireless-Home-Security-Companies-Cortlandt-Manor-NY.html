<p>CCTV Security Cameras are the building blocks of any Video Surveillance CCTV camera have positively been able to create a lot of publicity for itself during the modern years. 9. In a protective alarm system, a light source, an optical system for dividing light from said source into a plurality of beams extending across an area to be protected comprising a pair of mirrors and a pair of lenses cooperating therewith, said mirrors deflecting said light to a point in space, a photo-cell for receiving said light, a light chopper for normally passing a constant quantity of light and passing a varying quantity of light when one beam is intercepted by an intruder in said area and signal means responsive to said varying light.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>

<p>Today's video surveillance systems aren't just about security cameras. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Homeowners who have installed burglar alarm systems statistically stand a better chance of avoiding invasion than those without protection.

The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating ‘Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy. In the last few years, the video surveillance market has seen a major transformation into third generation video surveillance systems, moving to IP video from traditional analog video causing better processing power and improved compression algorithm 3 These Intelligent video surveillance systems are not just confined to laboratories but have hit the marketplace as well.</p>
