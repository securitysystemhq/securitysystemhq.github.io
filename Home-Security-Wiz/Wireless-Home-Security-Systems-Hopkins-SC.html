If you can link all your smart home devices into a voice control unit, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, then that's even better.</p>

<p>Additionally, devices that connect via Wi-Fi, such as security cameras and smart door locks, can be hacked to gain access to your home network. The operators observing the test could not believe it was night-time when viewing the camera. The company will find it difficult if not impossible to monitor the security systems when all of their equipment and employees are sitting in the dark.

<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
