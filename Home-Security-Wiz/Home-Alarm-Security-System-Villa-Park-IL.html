<p>One might think that the function of a fire alarm is to provide you with important evidence about a fire existing, allowing you to change your policy accordingly and exit the building. This section will describe the basic aspects of fire detection and alarm systems. By utilizing solid state storage on each camera, the MV family has removed the network video recorder (NVR) and its complexity from the equation. Has revealed 30% of false burglar alarms are triggered by insects and one in 10 false alarms is set off by a pet. It also supports a huge list of camera manufacturers (including IP cameras) so you aren't locked into a specific camera vendor or limited to a specific type of video capture hardware.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely. They are great for those in rented accommodation as they can be removed just as easily as they were installed so when you move on to your new home, you can take the alarm system with you. Fire alarms reduce property loss: While strobe lights and sirens don't actively put out fires, they alert the people who can.</p>
