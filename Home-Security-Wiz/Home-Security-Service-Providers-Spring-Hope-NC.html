<p>When any of the security sensors are breached by an intruder, the control panel relays a message to the monitoring service or sets off your home-mounted alarm. However, you need to remind yourself that while there are outdoor cameras equipped with high tech functions and features, you only need to choose one that meets your needs, budget and lifestyle.

<p>The siren and lights will alert the householder or neighbors that someone has broken into the house and the sound will often drive the intruder to run away quickly. Magnetic contacts will cause the alarm to sound if the circuit is broken: the neatest and most effective are flush-lilting (like mortice locks); surface-mounted contacts are easier to install and may be the only option on double doors or metal-framed windows.</p>
<p>Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
<p>And if a component of a DIY system fails, the homeowner is responsible for repairing or replacing it. With a traditional system, the home security company will typically replace faulty equipment for free, or for a minimal charge.
