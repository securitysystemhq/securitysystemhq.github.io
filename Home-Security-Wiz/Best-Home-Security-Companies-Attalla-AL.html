<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>In addition, any attempt to force entry that is detected is forwarded to an alarm control panel, which then reliably sets off a loud alarm and the offender is forced to escape. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
<p>Whenever the alarm in your home burglar alarm system sounds, and you do not enter the pass code immediately to terminate the alarm, your local law enforcement will be contacted. The best place to find a suitable home security alarm monitoring company is to go online and research companies offering this service in your immediate location. You can focus instead on how quickly the service which monitors your home burglar alarm system will notify local law enforcement, the size of your residence, and your budget.</p>
