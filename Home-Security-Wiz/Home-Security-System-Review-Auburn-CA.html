<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

We deal in IP CCTV, CCTV Cameras installations, Biometric systems, Fire Detection Systems which are easy to operate, highly sensitive and offer high performance. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance.</p>

Deep Sentinel is the only all-in-one home security system that blends next-generation wireless HD cameras with predictive local artificial intelligence and real-time human intervention to prevent a crime before it happens.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at. You can never tell by looking at it in distance. One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally. A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing. The usual forms of such photoelectric burglar alarm systems operate on the absolute principle, i. e., the amount of light reaching the cell surface determines the voltage on the control grid of the associated vacuum tube.</p>
