<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire.

<p>Today's video surveillance systems aren't just about security cameras. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Homeowners who have installed burglar alarm systems statistically stand a better chance of avoiding invasion than those without protection. First of all, they are not truly wireless, as the majority of wireless cameras still require a power cord to be run to a power socket.</p>
