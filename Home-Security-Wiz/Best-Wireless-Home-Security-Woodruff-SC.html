Sprinkler systems look bad and will harm the building's appearance. Not all surveillance cameras are static. This box camera includes a 6-60 mm variable focal auto-iris lens which gives security installers a lot of flexibility to adjust the camera angle of view and zoom level.

<p>The choice is really up to you, but seeing how the alarm is a key component in any home security system, you should try to spend more here instead of on less practical components such as motion detectors and the likes.
