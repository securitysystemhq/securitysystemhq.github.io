<p>Initially, fire alarm systems are designed to detect any element associated with fires. Modern line detectors are very stable and false alarms caused by animal motion, rain, fog or snow have been eliminated. Conspicuously placed cameras have been proven to reduce threats of violence and vandalism at businesses dramatically. It uses Z-Wave enabled devices to make it easy for you to automate lights, locks, thermostats, and moreâ€”no matter which level of monitoring you select.

<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
