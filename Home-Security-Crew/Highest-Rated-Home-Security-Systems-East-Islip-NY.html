<p>Landline, broadband, and cellular monitoring are different ways your home security system can be connected to the monitoring center. Digital video surveillance systems based on the principle of binary encoding of information that improves performance reading and writing data speed, improves quality of the signal transmitted by the camera and allows off-site internet viewing.
