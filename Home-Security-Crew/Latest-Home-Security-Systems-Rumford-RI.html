<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>

Smoke information classification solves the problem of low accuracy of traditional smoke alarms. Some dummy cameras do have added features such as a cable that can be fitted into a conduit to make it look even more real and I do think this is a good idea.</p>

<p>Such cameras are available in multiple types such as in Dome or Bullet shaped Cameras. Once an image has been picked by the camera, it is taken to the monitor and then recorded on video tape or DVR.
