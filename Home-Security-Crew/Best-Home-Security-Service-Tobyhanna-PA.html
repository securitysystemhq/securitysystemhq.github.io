Some security cameras have been designed to be small that they can be concealed in everyday objects such as toys and household appliances.

<p>Any potential intruders will see that you have an alarm system in place and are likely to move on to a more vulnerable property than yours. One-stage fire alarm systems warn everyone in the building that a sensor has been activated. Some devices can only be controlled by a remote control whilst others can be controlled in multiple ways: a physical switch on the device itself, a remote control, and a smartphone or any web-enabled device.</p>
