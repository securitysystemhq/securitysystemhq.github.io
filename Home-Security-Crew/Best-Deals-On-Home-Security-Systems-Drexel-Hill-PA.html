Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>
<p>Homeowners can choose between a landline, broadband or cellular connected system, and the system is controlled through a base station rather than through a keypad on a control panel like most home security systems.
