<p>Fire alarm systems are installed in commercial and residential buildings for the sole purpose to avoid fire and smoke. Learn more about professional installation services here. Zmodo offers Zmodo Cloud Service to store, share and playback your security camera's footage. After years of development, surveillance cameras can provide higher resolution images and clearer audio. Cameras should be mounted as close possible to the field of view required, and the closer the camera to the subject the better the identification of the subject will be. Proper lens selection relative to the camera location and the FoV required is essential to a quality picture.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
