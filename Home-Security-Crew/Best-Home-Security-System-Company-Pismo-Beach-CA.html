<p>Experts believe that CCTV discourages opportunistic crime, where an offender spontaneously takes advantage of a situation. Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>
<p>Today's home security systems are effective and affordable. Installing number of cameras allows the security staff to watch both the customers and employees to prevent theft of shop supplies. Surveillance systems can be used to monitor your entryways and windows, and can also be monitored either by you on your smartphone or by a company if desired.

<p>On the minus side is the inconvenience of activating and deactivating the alarm, and the cost and problems with false alarms. Good Wi-Fi coverage is essential, and most systems will have a range of around 20-50metres, but if you have black spots around the house the system may struggle. Manual fire alarms are used to alert an entire building in the event of a fire. The system is based on coaxial or electro-magnetic sensor cable with the controller having the ability to differentiate between signals from the cable or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing the fence, or bad weather conditions.</p>
