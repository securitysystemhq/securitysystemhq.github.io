<p>CCTV (Closed Circuit TV) uses one or more video cameras to transmit video and sometimes audio images to a monitor, set of monitors, or video recorder. Many professionally monitored home security systems require a contract, and contract length can range from three to five years. You can install one of these alarms yourself, or you can pay a one-off fee to have it installed by a professional. Networks of cameras are installed by government agencies and by local businesses, but the distinction blurs with the development of real-time crime centers that access both public and private video feeds.</p>

CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes.

The most effective systems are those which are monitored by trained staff, have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress, and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>Monitored alarms and speaker phones allow for the central station to speak with the homeowner or intruder. We are a chain of over 30+ eye centers spreaded all over India Managing and keeping a check on all the branches for us was a very tiring job until we hired My Third eye 's CCTV monitoring services. Hard-wired smoke detectors need to have a battery backup or some other backup power source to keep them running.</p>

The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating ‘Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.
