Today; however, reliable home security companies have come to realize that an audible alarm is sometimes simply not enough to completely eliminate the threat of a home invasion. Associating DVR systems along with CCTV security cameras is a brilliant idea but cabling complexities and the problem of managing of the cables will always be there.</p>
<p>All these capabilities make alarm systems more robust, not only in terms of security but also in terms of supervision flexibility.

C-mount cameras can cover distances beyond 40 ft thanks to the possibility to use special lenses with these cameras, whereas standard CCTV lenses can only cover distances of 35-40 ft.

<p>If you really want to record the scene going on in the premises then you need to take the help of DVR (digital video recorder) systems.
