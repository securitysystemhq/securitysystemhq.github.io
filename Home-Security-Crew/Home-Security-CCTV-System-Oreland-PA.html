It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed.

There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>

CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
