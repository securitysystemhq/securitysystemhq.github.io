<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Think of the alarm system connected to the door. Security cameras can keep an eye out for criminal activity, but they also give family members the ability to monitor the person and the home remotely. If there's one thing you can say for SimpliSafe, it's that it's cheap You'll pay way less for SimpliSafe sensors and equipment than you would for something like Vivint or ADT.

<p>Wyze cameras are especially popular among folks who want simple security for dropping in. However, they do require microSD cards to record footage and can be a bit slow to log on and check-in after receiving a push notification. These are essential devices to look for when purchasing a DIY security system. We offer complete HD security camera systems that include a DVR, cameras, cables, connectors and power supplies.</p>

Wired cameras are hard wired to the security system, meaning you need to physically string power and data cables from a central hub or recording device to each individual camera.</p>
<p>Don't DIY your smart home security system - the pros at Vivint are totally worth the cost. On the other hand, security cameras require a more detailed view, as the footage is seen later and is needed to present evidence in the court.
