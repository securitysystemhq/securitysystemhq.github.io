<p>The surveillance cameras did nothing to help the man. SD Card - many IP cameras come with SD card storage and the main video footage stored is when there are motions detected. An annunciator panel is sometimes employed to monitor the status of the different areas in a designated fire zone for theft protection and control of a facility's alarm devices. Usually the microphonic detection systems are installed as sensor cables attached to rigid chainwire fences, however some specialised versions of these systems can also be installed as buried systems underground.</p>
