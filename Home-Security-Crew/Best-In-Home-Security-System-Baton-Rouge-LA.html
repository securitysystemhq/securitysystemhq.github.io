This camera performs very similarly to the Nest Cam Outdoor, with the capability to deliver crystal-clear 1080p images day and night and with two-way communication so you can hear and talk to whoever is in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Every system comes with a free app that allows you to view your cameras anywhere in the world as long as you have internet.
