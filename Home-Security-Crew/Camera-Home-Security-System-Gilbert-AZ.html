<p>Have you ever noticed that your fire alarm or your smoke alarm goes off every time you cook? We constantly push the boundaries of technology to develop intelligent solutions that go beyond the highest security demands of today and deliver clear business advantages beyond security. In this case individual plug in power supplies are used to power them with power cable running as separate and independent line to the camera. Some of the lower-quality home security systems come with only basic door and window sensors that customers can easily install themselves.</p>
<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off. Without the cable keeping lights, alarms, and sprinkler systems operating, tragedies are going to happen.
