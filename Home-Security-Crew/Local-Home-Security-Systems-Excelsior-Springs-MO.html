<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system.

From this approach the "intelligence" capability of all the distributed net will be applied to react in a much more efficient way to the different alarm situations that can occur, being the alarm systems able to distinguish more accurately real security violations from, for example, unadvertedly operations, increasing security levels and also the immunity to technical failures.</p>
