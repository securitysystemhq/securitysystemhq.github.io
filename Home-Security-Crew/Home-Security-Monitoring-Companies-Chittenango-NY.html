<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. Professional monitoring gives you peace of mind during an alarm, no matter where you are. Add sensors using your phone's camera by scanning the QR code present behind the sensor. An individual (not a business or organization), may record a conversation as long as one of the participants has consented to the recording.</p>
<p>NOTE: People with atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias may not be good candidates for home monitoring because electronic home blood pressure devices may not be able to give accurate measurements. Today's surveillance cameras pair with mobile apps to control your security camera using your mobile device. It's important to find an outdoor security camera that only records when motion is detected to cut electricity costs or battery usage.</p>

<p>These cameras are not always distinguishable from conventional security cameras, however the brand name FLIR is often a tell-tale sign that the camera is capable of thermal imaging.
