In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance.</p>
<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely.

In most cases, the installation process will begin with connecting the cameras either to their power source or to the network.

<p>4. A fire alarm inspection also includes checking whether fire extinguishers and other fire alarm devices are in the right places where people can get to them quickly in case of a fire.
