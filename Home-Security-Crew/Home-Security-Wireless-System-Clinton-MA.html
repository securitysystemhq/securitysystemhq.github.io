<p>CCTV security cameras have come a long way since being first introduced into the market in the late 1960's. We deal in a wide assortment of products including video surveillance systems, time attendance system, finger print based time attendance system, card based time and attendance system, biometric (finger print) door lock, CCTV camera system, IR camera, night vision camera, networking multi-doors controller, box camera, PTZ dome camera, dome camera, heat detectors, PIR sensor, long distance inductive guard tour system and guard tour system for non-security personnel.</p>

An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>The least expensive is the wired camera and it can be wired through a security DVR to your computer or to your router and the Internet. A key aspect of fire protection is to identify a developing fire emergency in a timely manner, and to alert the building's occupants and fire emergency organizations. Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection.</p>
