In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras connected—either hardwired or wireless— to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. However, it is important to ensure the reliability and safe operation of fire-fighting equipment and installed systems such as fire alarms and emergency lighting.</p>
<p>Wireless alarms are also portable, so can be removed temporarily for decorating or permanently if you decide to move home. To protect visitors, employees and exhibits from fire, local Bosch partner Elektroprojekt installed the Modular Alarm Platform 5000 with 700 intrusion detectors securing administrative and office areas in addition to the storage of the museum's collection.
