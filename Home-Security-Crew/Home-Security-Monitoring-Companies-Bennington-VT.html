<p>All these things working in unison and correctly have often saved the lives of people who were in buildings that have caught fire.

<p>In this instance, we're talking about home security systems, which are networks of integrated electronic devices working together with a central control panel to protect against burglars and other potential home intruders. Mounted in places such as driveways, parking lots, parking garages, and car alarm stores, video surveillance cameras are valuable in protecting one's investment. Smoke and fire detectors that aren't wired directly into your alarm system cannot summon emergency personnel.</p>
<p>Closed-circuit television ( CCTV ), also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors.
