<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>Strategically placed cameras could mean would-be burglars bypass your business for an easier target. This is as simple as it sounds, wired burglar alarm systems mean that all the connecting component parts need to be wired together to complete the electrical circuit. The security systems run from $500,000 per district for an analog system consisting of CCTV (closed circuit television) monitors to million-dollar IP-based systems with digital surveillance cameras connected to a web network.</p>
<p>You may have to do some systems troubleshooting especially when there are many false alarms. When an existing Customer moves away from the protected home or business and another Person or Company moves in, it will be simple for the Alarm Company to change the system parameters to suit the new Customer.

A:In order to find out if someone tried to break into your house or it was a false alarm, you would need to check if the alarm was triggered because of incorrect key codes, if you ran into the house without disarming the system, or your pet moved into the sight of a motion detector.</p>
