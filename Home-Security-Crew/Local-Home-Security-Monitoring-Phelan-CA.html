<p>While outdoor cameras are really useful devices, have you ever wondered how they work? Provide cellular connectivity and management support, making them ideal for use in remote patient monitoring, clinical trials or for health visitors and social workers. For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, causing more than 100 of the cameras to go dark. Panic alarms receive police response based on fear of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally receive fire response based on an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>These cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras.

Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>
