Spy Cameras - these are covert cameras that record images or footage without being visible. Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover.

A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>More recently, decentralized IP cameras , perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation. It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.
