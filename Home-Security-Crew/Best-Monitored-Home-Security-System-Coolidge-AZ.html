The special challenge was to install safety systems thereby paying special attention to preserving the historical details of the building.

<p>Digital Security surveillance cameras are much smaller. Our top picks for security cameras will send alerts to your phone when they detect motion, be able to record in HD quality even at night, and are designed to withstand any type of weather. Recently, manufacturers have begun to introduce and market smoke detectors that combine ionization and photoelectric sensors in the same unit. The vast majority of people today are opting for wireless set ups that can allow for both professional monitoring in the event of a break-in, as well as the ability to view various rooms in the home from tablets or phones.</p>
<p>In addition, the equipment and installation costs may vary by company, so you can save by comparison shopping. Maintenance employees can use video surveillance cameras to detect equipment that needs repair and equipment that is operating in an unsafe manner.

<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
