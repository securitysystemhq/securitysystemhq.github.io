We constantly push the boundaries of technology to develop intelligent solutions that go beyond the highest security demands of today and deliver clear business advantages beyond security.

Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>
<p>Security definitions can be adapted to each intruder alarm control system, for an individual security policy. Under this range, we comprises Burglar Alarm System and Intrusion Alarm System. With a CCTV camera, you loose image quality every time you transfer the video from the analog signal when it is digitized in the cameras Digital Signal Processor, which is then converted back to analog to run up the coax cable, which is again digitized at the DVR for recording.</p>

Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on gives you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away. The detection principle of an Addressable System is the same as a Conventional System except that each detector is given a set Address (usually by means of a dip-switch) and the Control Panel can then determine exactly which detector or call point has initiated the alarm.</p>
<p>Interested in surveillance systems using specialized cameras. Another object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric detection system which is selfcompensating in that changes of ambient light, such as daylight or artificial illumination, will not cause the system to give an alarm and which cannot be defeated by using a flash-light or some other form of light source.
