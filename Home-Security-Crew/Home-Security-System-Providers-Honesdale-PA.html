<p>Wireless security panels are generally very easy to program, making them great for DIY users. The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and better systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, as well as internal trouble indicators (mains power loss, low battery, broken wire, etc.). Some manufacturers call a camera wireless” because it uses a Wi-Fi connection, and others refer to cameras that don't need to be plugged into an outlet.</p>
