IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>Service Providers can give their customer, the homeowner, the power to monitor and control many devices in the home: Thermostats, door locks, lighting, cameras - while at home or away. Intelligent intrusion detection is a delicate balance between responding to real security breaches and ignoring costly false alarm sources.

There are a few other questions you might want to consider before you select your burglar alarm system.
