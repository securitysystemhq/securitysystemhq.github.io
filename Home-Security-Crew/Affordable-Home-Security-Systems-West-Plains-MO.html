<p>Many people share a grave misconception about the use and application of fire alarm systems. This security camera is pretty generic and provides a decent quality of about 720p resolution. Closed circuit television is one of the most effective and commonly used types of video surveillance available on the market, but is a step above in price from wireless cameras. It's great value for the money, and you can even try it for free for 15 days to see if you like the equipment, monitoring, and service.
