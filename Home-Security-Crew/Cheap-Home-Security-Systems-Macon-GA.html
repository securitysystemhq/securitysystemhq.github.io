<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>

<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that's the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>

If you want more peace of mind that a problem at your home will be dealt with quickly, you could consider a burglar alarm with a monitoring contract - 38% of the people we spoke pay for one of these.</p>
<p>When you are selecting your burglar alarm system, you will have to decide what kind of sensors you want.

<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use.

<p>In order for a company to provide live monitoring, they must charge a monthly fee, since they will either be connecting your service to the company's central system through a landline phone or through cellular technology. Leaving windows unprotected by bars, safety locks, or a home alarm system open also draws attention and adds to easy of entry for an intruder. The best cameras now offer computer-like functions and features, like motion sensors and automatic mobile notifications.</p>
<p>Good quality cameras will produce quality images and the reverse will apply as well. A traditional wired system will need to be installed by a professional, and often requires some drilling (and holes in your walls) to connect the sensors to the main alarm system. Responding to false alarms can consume thousands of personnel hours at a cost to taxpayers and place the safety of citizens truly in need of law enforcement response in jeopardy.</p>
