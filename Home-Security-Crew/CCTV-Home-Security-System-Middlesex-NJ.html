If you have an Xfinity X1 cable TV box, you can control the system from there and watch live video from the camera. We specialize in providing an extensive range of CCTV cameras, and performing research and development in Camera DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for other renowned manufacturers.

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
<p>To simplify the process, we have several YouTube videos that will teach you by example how to connect all the wires together and operate the friendly point & click interface of our security DVR recorders The DVR is easy to operate thanks to the intuitive user interface and the included mouse, and hand-held remote control. It means that the closed door breaks the circuit, and if the door opens the circuit is completed and energy flows and sounds the alarm.</p>

CCTV systems can also use internet protocol (IP) to send out images in digital form to specified networks.
