To better understand the mechanism by which daily RM reduced all-cause and CV mortality in IN-TIME, Hindricks et al. 44 recently performed an individual patient meta-analysis (Truecoin) of three Home Monitoring trials: TRUST, ECOST, and IN-TIME (Table 1 ). The composite CV endpoints combining CV- or all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization, and the composite WHF endpoints combining WHF- or all-cause mortality and WHF hospitalization were analysed.</p>

Overall, many individuals may find that wired security cameras are a better fit for their needs, but wireless cameras are still a great option for those desiring the latest technology and less clutter.

<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
<p>These types of systems may or may not allow for text messages or email notifications to be sent to the homeowner in the event of a security breach, depending on the provider and the system you opted for. For wireless setup, the process is easier and the cameras can be connected remotely in minutes. Upgrade your security and your lifestyle when you pair a Frontpoint security system with compatible smart home tools like Amazon Alexa or Google Home.</p>
