Furthermore, for remote monitoring validation the system is tested under Wi-Fi and 3G wireless protocols to find out about time delay, that is, the time taken to send data from patient's interface to doctor's interface, and found that the message sending time for both wireless protocols is under acceptable range of medical standards (4 to 6 minutes as per American Heart Association).</p>

<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted. Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>
<p>These are stand-alone battery operated smoke detectors generally used in homes and offices where electrical wiring is already completed. The introduced system operation is supported by a GSM embedded mobile module, which enables the alert messages transmission to both mobile devices of end users, and central security offices.
