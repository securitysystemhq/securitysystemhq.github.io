<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors).
