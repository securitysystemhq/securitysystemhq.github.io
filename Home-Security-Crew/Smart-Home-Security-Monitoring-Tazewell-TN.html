These modern smart fire alarm systems are more sensitive than classic models and are better at avoiding false alarms.

<p>Motion sensing cameras can send an alert to your security company or your smartphone app when they are triggered, allowing you to get a feed just at the moment you need it, rather than all the time. A:Most companies do not give a lot of time when the alarm is first activated to when you personally disarm it. If you haven't disarmed it in this given time frame, the monitoring center would receive your information in about 10 seconds or as specified by your home security company.</p>
