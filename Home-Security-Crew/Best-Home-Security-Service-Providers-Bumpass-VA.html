<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The center gives an edge in monitoring operations & managing maintenance of all connected sites, providing instant insights and real-time proactive action - ensuring maximum generation & uptime. With this information, the role and interaction of these supplemental fire safety systems in the protection process can then be better realized. Your video surveillance system can be tailored to your requirements with many cameras and configurations available.</p>
<p>Discreet CCTV cameras beneficial because criminals will be less likely to spot them and therefore, they are less likely to be damaged in the process.
