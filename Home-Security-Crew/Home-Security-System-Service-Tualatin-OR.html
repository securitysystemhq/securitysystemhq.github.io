The thermal imaging technology has drastically evolved since then, and thermal imaging cameras have evolved to become compact in size and look like a digital photo camera, they are now easy to use and produce real-time crisp high-resolution images making them a widely important tool for industrial applications 8 They can detect anomalies that are generally invisible to the naked human eye, thus taking corrective preventing costly systems going for a total breakdown.</p>
<p>But when the door or window is opened by an intruder, the circuit will be open, thus the alarm will be triggered. A video surveillance camera can be used for other types of tests on cars.
