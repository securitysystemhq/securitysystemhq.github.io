<p>All the components of the system are interconnected using many cameras for critical sites, by means of IP mega pixel cameras. There are two types of security cameras systems, Analog and IP (sometimes refered to as network cameras). Analog cameras: These are usually lower resolution than the more modern IP technology, and require cable connections to a DVR to record and store footage, plus wired connections for power.</p>
<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.

<h3>CCTV Installation - How To Secure an IP Security Camera in Franklin</h3>
<p>LifeShield provides home security solutions for the DIY-er and individual who prefers professional installation. What this means is that the camera can be powered and transfer video feed all with one Cat5 cable, rather than running a power cable and a separate video cable the way that analog cameras do.

Initiate optional ADT professional monitoring services, receive alerts, or set lights and other connected devices to turn on and off when carbon monoxide is detected in your home.
