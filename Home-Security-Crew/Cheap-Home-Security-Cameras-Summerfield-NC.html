<p>A VIP system consists of a video camera (a digitiser in the case of analogue cameras) and a microprocessor for processing the digital-image - and software to interpret the image content and extract detection information from it. You may have noticed that the use of security systems, surveillance cameras, security guards and even 'under-cover' security personnel has increased dramatically in malls and even small mom-and-pop and convenience stores.</p>
<p>Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
<p>A stronger and more effective mechanism in the form of security cameras is to be used. 4G LTE security camera , also called cellular camera , runs on 4G data with a built-in SIM card instead of the router network to work. Operators often wish to see a sequence of images from successive CCTV cameras, in the form of a video tour” (See Traffic Control ).
