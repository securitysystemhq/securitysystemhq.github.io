For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>If something sets off the alarm, the company that is monitoring it will alert the local police to address the situation. Monitoreal needs to be on your home network in order to see your cameras.

There are typically two options for adding video surveillance: Pay a fee to have an alarm company install, monitor and respond to video alerts, or purchase a video surveillance system from a retail store and install it yourself.
