<p>Sometimes also known as CCTV or Closed Circuit Television, video surveillance systems can allow you to track and monitor anything going on inside your home whether you're there or not. Although many video surveillance cameras appear to be similar and provide the same specifications, they aren't the same. If you add a surveillance camera to your security system, you will double your protection. Thus, the motion detection system has been incorporated in the basic workings of alarm systems.</p>

Any home security camera worth its salt will support motion detection.</p>
<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself. But there are also several drawbacks when you opt to use a smoke alarm instead of the fire alarm panel. The rising awareness regarding the benefits of CCTV cameras in commercial sector is also increasing the demand for CCTV cameras.

The motion detectors for indoors are suitable for stores, offices, public facilities and residential buildings, in addition to manufacturing, machine shops and garages, for example. Disadvantages: expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost), and a high rate of false alarms as it cannot distinguish some pets from humans.</p>
<p>The computerized logic of the control panel analyzes multiple detectors at the same time to decide on the most appropriate course of action. Smart fire alarm systems can perform integrated automatic actions, for example, discharge fire-suppression systems in closed designated areas; and vary the notifications to support people on their way out, while protecting expensive electronic equipment inside.
