<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off.

DVRs generally offer what is known as D1 resolution, which is the traditional video quality used in closed-circuit television systems.</p>

These will allow you to remotely access, monitor, and control your entire home security system and much of your home's equipment such as door locks, window blinds, small appliances, thermostat, garage door, and more.

Conversely, advanced digital cameras are those that are not connected by a circuit but can be located at any site around the world. Most fire alarms provide information about where the fire is located to emergency responders. Outdoor cameras are one of the best ways to deter (and catch) burglars, vandals, and other miscreants.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
