<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off. Without the cable keeping lights, alarms, and sprinkler systems operating, tragedies are going to happen. This feature allows you to disable the interior motion sensors but leaves the perimeter sensors active for the best in home security. DVRs generally offer what is known as D1 resolution, which is the traditional video quality used in closed-circuit television systems.</p>
<p>In the case of pan-and-tilt cameras, the camera lens will automatically point itself in the direction of the motion and record. Before secondary and middle school officials install video surveillance systems to prevent vandalism, gang activity, fights, trespassing or theft, they must sit down and conduct a thorough inventory of their needs and security concerns. The STROBE signal is the output from the alarm control panel that will enable the flash lamps from the external sounder.</p>

Features such as high-quality video surveillance cameras, doorbell cameras, a mobile app, environmental disaster protection (for fire and water intrusion), an advanced control panel with a panic button, loud siren, and two-way talk, etc. Protect America subcontracts its monitoring services to COPS Monitoring, an award-winning, UL-certified company with six nationwide monitoring stations and a 16.2-second average priority alarm response time.</p>

Adiline Macriga, Smart Home Monitoring and Controlling System Using Android Phone, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Website: (ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 11, November 2013).</p>
