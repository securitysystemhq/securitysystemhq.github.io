<p>Most office buildings, school, hospitals and homes today have fire alarm systems installed. Once you've installed your system, simply connect the DVR to your internet router or modem and you can view your cameras anywhere in the world at no additional charge. A bespoke intruder alarm system, supplied and maintained by ClearView, will deter and detect potential intruders to your site.

With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>
