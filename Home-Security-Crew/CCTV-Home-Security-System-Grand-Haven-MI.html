Alert systems can also close fire doors, recall elevators, and interface and monitor the installed suppression systems, such as sprinklers.</p>

<p>Detectors might be sited in other areas of the building, but the objective is to protect the escape route. These are the two types of alarm systems.

To further complicate the situation, there are many local security dealers that do not advertise the brand name that will be doing the monitoring.</p>
<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.

A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>In the previous two systems, the Conventional Fire Alarm System” and the Addressable Fire Alarm System” the detectors are not considered intelligent” as they can only give output signals representing the value of detected phenomena. Systems range from small, self-contained noisemakers, to complicated, multirally systems with computer monitoring and control.
