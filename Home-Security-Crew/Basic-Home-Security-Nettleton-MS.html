<p>Hear what patients have to say about their experiences with remote monitoring. The software that comes with the camera is usually functional enough for basic viewing, though control center software allows you to watch multiple locations at one time. The control panel will now regard this as a fire condition, and will enter its alarm mode. Our recognized experts verify the functionality and operational reliability of equipment and building services specific to fire protection systems.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
