<p>Experts believe that CCTV discourages opportunistic crime, where an offender spontaneously takes advantage of a situation. Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems.

Today home security systems are extremely advanced, offering inexpensive professionally monitored DIY solutions up to highly sophisticated systems requiring professional installation.</p>
<p>Such systems continue to enjoy general public support but they do involve intrusion into the lives of ordinary people as they go about their day to day business and can raise wider privacy concerns. When you place a security company's sticker in a front window and plant their sign in your front yard, you are telling burglars you home is professionally protected and not a wise choice for an attempted burglary.</p>
<p>For this reason, most fire alarm systems are designed with one or more manual alarm activation devices to be used by the person who discovers a fire. The Pan Tilt and Zoom Cameras (PTZ) can be remotely controlled to pan (left or right), tilt (up and down) or zoom in to an object or revert back to wide-angle for a larger field of view.

<p>LifeShield provides home security solutions for the DIY-er and individual who prefers professional installation. What this means is that the camera can be powered and transfer video feed all with one Cat5 cable, rather than running a power cable and a separate video cable the way that analog cameras do. Another perk of using IP CCTV cameras is that the resolution that can be achieved far surpasses the video quality that can be delivered while using analog technology.</p>
<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. A high-quality home security camera system is one of the easiest ways to deter criminals from breaking into a home. Some outdoor CCTV surveillance camera systems are manually operated meaning a security personnel views the images and videos transmitted by the cameras from a specific location; and there are also those that can be operated remotely.</p>

Take care of employee disputes - If two employees are in the middle of a dispute, the visual proof can put an end to it. It is amazing what surveillance cameras can do in this instance.
