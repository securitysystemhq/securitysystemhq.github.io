Cameras include Greet for the front door, Pivot for indoor monitoring, Torch Pro for lighting up and monitoring outdoors.

This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
