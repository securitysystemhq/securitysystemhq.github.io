<p>However, the supplied 10-foot power cord limits placement and isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a Nest), and notifications that distinguish between people and general motion will cost you an additional $10 per month. You should also make sure that your local police department accepts the burglar alarm. A substantial amount of time can be saved during investigation and prosecution by using evidence from security camera footage.</p>
