<p>Alerts: A good outdoor security camera will alert your smartphone or tablet whenever motion is detected. A very important application for any DVR system is the ability to monitor live and access to recordings through remote access. To prevent a clandestine attack using a secondary light source being used to hold the detector in a sealed condition whilst an intruder passes through, most systems use and detect a modulated light source.</p>
<p>Analogue signals can also be converted into a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings In that case the analogue video camera must be plugged directly into a video capture card in the computer, and the card then converts the analogue signal to digital.
