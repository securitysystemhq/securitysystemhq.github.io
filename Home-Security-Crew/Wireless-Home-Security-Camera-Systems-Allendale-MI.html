<p>One might think that the function of a fire alarm is to provide you with important evidence about a fire existing, allowing you to change your policy accordingly and exit the building. This section will describe the basic aspects of fire detection and alarm systems. By utilizing solid state storage on each camera, the MV family has removed the network video recorder (NVR) and its complexity from the equation. Has revealed 30% of false burglar alarms are triggered by insects and one in 10 false alarms is set off by a pet. It also supports a huge list of camera manufacturers (including IP cameras) so you aren't locked into a specific camera vendor or limited to a specific type of video capture hardware.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>Ask the home security company for an itemized breakdown of all charges, which may include equipment costs, installation fees, monthly monitoring charges and more. The Digital Video Recorder also known as a DVR is used to take footage or video taken by a security camera and storing it as the name says, digitally, onto a hard drive. The camera uses a number of sensors to detect the presence of a person in the room and monitor their activities.</p>

Video surveillance cameras have two main types of connections: wired or wireless. Burglar alarm circuits are constructed in a similar manner, other than the fact that instead on flipping a switch, the alarm's circuits are completed when it detects an intrusion like a breaking of a window, or opening a door, when it is activated.</p>
