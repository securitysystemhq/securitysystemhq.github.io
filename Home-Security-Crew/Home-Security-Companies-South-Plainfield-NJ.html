Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors.

<p>To further explain this, assume that a building's fire alarm system has 5 circuits, zones A through E, and that each circuit has 10 smoke detectors and 2 manual stations located in various rooms of each zone. The standard size is 380 TVL to 420 TVL cameras high quality up to 480 TVL to 570 TVL. Few do-it-yourself wired systems contain movement detectors, but they can usually be added as an extra.
