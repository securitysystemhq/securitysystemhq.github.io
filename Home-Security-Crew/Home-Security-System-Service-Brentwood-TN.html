<p>However, the supplied 10-foot power cord limits placement and isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a Nest), and notifications that distinguish between people and general motion will cost you an additional $10 per month. You should also make sure that your local police department accepts the burglar alarm. A substantial amount of time can be saved during investigation and prosecution by using evidence from security camera footage.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring - Many DIY home security providers don't offer professional monitoring to watch over your home at all times. The most popular fixed temperature detectors used in homes are preset to sound an alarm when the temperature exceeds 135 degrees F. Other units are available to be preset up to temperatures of approximately 200 to 225 degrees F. These detectors may be used in an attic where summer temperatures normally may reach 135 degrees F.</p>
