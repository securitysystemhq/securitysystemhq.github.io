<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>We provide burglar alarms which utilize the most recent innovation to secure your belonging and can be customized to suit your particular needs. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets or security personnel on patrolling and physical surveillance. They come in wide variety of configurations, but generally how alarms work is with a network of motion detectors and door and window sensors integrated with a control panel.</p>

On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>
