<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>

It has been noticed that, IP Storage Area Network is gaining traction over digital and network video recorders for storage as it proposes enhanced scalability, retention and huge storage capacity. You'll use the keypad to activate and deactivate the system, and if the panel is advanced, you may be able to use it to do things like program alarm settings.</p>
<p>For example, if you have mobility issues, you will probably want as many home automation features as you can get your hands on. These will allow you to remotely access, monitor, and control your entire home security system and much of your home's equipment such as door locks, window blinds, small appliances, thermostat, garage door, and more.

<p>Whilst IP CCTV has been available for around 10 years, it is only in the last few years that the technology has matured, leading to the developments in Megapixel and High Definition (HD) technology. Again, when using video surveillance systems, the idea may be to let people know that they are being watched in order to keep them in line. With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone.</p>
<p>Institutions that involve monetary exchange like banks and casinos as well as public areas where many people congregate such as at airports, terminals and malls, are often secured by surveillance camera systems.

The demand for IP video surveillance systems is high in the commercial vertical owing to the increased awareness about the advantages offered by IP video surveillance systems over analog systems.</p>
