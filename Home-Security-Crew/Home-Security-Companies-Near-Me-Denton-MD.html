<p>With the different purposes of surveillance cameras, there is also a need for different types of these cameras in order to accomplish certain purposes. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Up to 32 control panels and parallel indicator panels - can be linked redundantly to a ring network. Hikvision's PanoVu Series cameras are perfectly designed for this purpose.</p>
