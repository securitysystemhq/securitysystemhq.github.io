<p>When you're looking for the best alarms and home security systems, these resources and tips will help you protect your home. A:There could be two situations in which a burglar alarm might be causing this nuisance: The volume is too high, or the neighbor's alarm went off and no one is doing anything about it. In the first scenario, try contacting your alarm company for information on how to do the following: • Lower the volume • Reduce the time for which the alarm sounds before silencing automatically • Change the tone of the alarm to something less sharp or high pitched Knowing these things will help you control any noise that might be irritating.</p>
