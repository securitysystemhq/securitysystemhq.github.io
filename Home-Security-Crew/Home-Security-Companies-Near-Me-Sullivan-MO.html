<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

The best place to find a suitable home security alarm monitoring company is to go online and research companies offering this service in your immediate location. You can focus instead on how quickly the service which monitors your home burglar alarm system will notify local law enforcement, the size of your residence, and your budget.</p>
