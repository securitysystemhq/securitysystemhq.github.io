<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>The ADT app makes controlling your home security simple and intuitive with our interface. Boasting 360-degree continuous pan range, and -5 to 90-degree or more tilt range, the speed dome series thermal cameras can automatically track targets in thermal and optical channels simultaneously when an alarm is triggered.

<p>Smaller systems have sensors for the main entry point and interior camera. This eliminates the need for cables, allowing installation to be much simpler than wired security cameras. CCTV Camera Pros is a direct supplier of security cameras and video surveillance systems for home, business, and government. Many types of businesses must have a video surveillance system in place to comply with HIPPA or SEC regulations as well as internal corporate policies.</p>
