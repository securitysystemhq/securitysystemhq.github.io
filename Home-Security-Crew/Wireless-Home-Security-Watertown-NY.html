<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service.

Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
