<p>It's not easy for people to appreciate the fire protection materials if they haven't experienced a real fire accident. With the new ColorVu Technology, Turbo HD ColorVu Cameras render clear images at 0.0005 lux, providing critical surveillance in ultra low-light scenarios. Additionally, you'll be pleased to note we provide (at minimum) a One Year Warranty on our CCTV cameras and products.

These can be photoelectric smoke and heat detectors, ionization smoke detectors, heat detectors, in-duct smoke detectors, manually operated pull stations and sprinkler waterflow sensors.</p>
