<p>4. The primitive CCTV systems was not applied in security monitoring until 1968 when New York was first to install video cameras in an effort to fight crime. Smartfrog has developed a smart connected camera for home video monitoring applications. Remote monitoring is seen as an acceptable addition to the process. The cameras were all configured accordingly and put through their paces one by one to test all functionally of the camera as well as image quality.</p>
<p>Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
<p>The addition of VIP significantly improves the usefulness of CCTV , particularly where there are a large number of cameras installed, which an operator cannot view at the same time. The control panel's microprocessor sends a constant interrogation signal over each circuit, in which each initiating device is contacted to inquire its status (normal or emergency). Plus prior to you actually testing the system you need to walk round the house to make sure that all doors and windows are closed.</p>
