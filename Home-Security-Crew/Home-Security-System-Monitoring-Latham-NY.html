The panel will then activate one or more signaling circuits to sound building alarms and summon emergency help. To further complicate the situation, there are many local security dealers that do not advertise the brand name that will be doing the monitoring.</p>

<p>Most have motion detection settings that only record footage when the camera detects movement.

<p>Intruder alarm systems connected through the network (first configuration). Hybrid alarm systems allow simultaneously the installation of wireless and hardwired detectors, being the most versatile. The installed alarm equipment remains the property of ADT.
