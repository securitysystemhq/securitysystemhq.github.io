<p>Apart from making a siren, the burglar systems are also used to lock the doors of the car and prevent the car from being used. In most cases, the installation process will begin with connecting the cameras either to their power source or to the network. The most common alarm systems use the principle of circuits: closed and open. These are LED bulbs fitted on the camera, and switch on automatically in low light conditions and allow the camera to see in the dark in black and white images.</p>
