The camera communicates with the monitors and the video recorders across the premises through cable or wireless communication links.</p>
<p>The most significant thing that these new IP cameras have in common is their accessibility. For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered. Among all the communications technology of alarm monitoring market, cellular wireless network expected to grow with the highest CAGR during forecast period.</p>
