<p>The development of modern society results in the growing security needs. Your system control panel is the center of a network of sensors, which may include window or door sensors, motion detectors, tamper sensors on the telephone box, or specialized temperature, flood, and smoke detectors. Watch this video to see the iDVR-PRO app for Android remotely viewing security cameras. The SereneLife Indoor IP Camera offers superb image quality that isn't compromised once the lights go out.</p>

Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
