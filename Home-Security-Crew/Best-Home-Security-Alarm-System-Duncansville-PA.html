<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>

In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>The user is also notified about any movement using data from the camera's motion sensor. The most common burglar alarm sensors can indicate the opening of a window or door. Heat detectors.

<h3>What Are The Best Home Security Cameras in Duncansville</h3>
<p>In case of analog cameras, an encoder must be installed to transmit analog video over IP. The input from an analog camera is encoded and output a digital stream for transmission over an IP network. The alarm itself is wired in low-voltage cable, but the control panel usually needs a connection to mains electricity via a fused connection unit. Being the network supported by a structure with Internet access, all monitoring and control, and programmer settings are reachable form any part of the globe (by using several internet access equipments, with different access privileges).</p>
<p>Along these lines, in spite of the way that video is being transmitted from the cameras in a simple organization, live and recorded video is as yet accessible over the system.
