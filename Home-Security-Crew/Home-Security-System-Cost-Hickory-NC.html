<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Stream your home cameras through your phone, arm your alarm system, and control all of your home devices from the same app. Abode also offers a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensor and one motion detector. They usually work on two principles: heat detection and smoke detection. By linking them with police control room, on the event of robbery or theft, the alarm will self-operate and send a message to the nearby PCR vans.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale are DIY-installed systems costing as little as £200. The monitoring company has guards watching the screens 24 hours a day just waiting to receive an alarm distress call. There's also a smartphone app and smart home compatibility built-in as well as optional monitoring from ADT and cellular backup.

Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as all photographic cameras. When deciding upon a home security system which will be suited to your house and needs, people often ask ‘which burglar alarm is best?'. Any home security camera worth its salt will support motion detection.</p>
<p>Security alarms are a helpful deterrent to ward off potential intruders but, although these clever bits of kits may be helping to fend off con artists, they can be known to be ‘trigger happy' over what constitutes a break-in. Many alarms panels are available with touch panels or touchpad screens. Many security systems can be controlled remotely by more than one user. The motion detectors used are like those in the alarm systems.</p>

<h4>Best Alarm System For Home Hickory 28601</h4>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted. Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>
<p>Siamese dual cable is commonly used that provides RG59u coax together with a pair of 18 gauge wire for the camera power requirements.
