<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>No, not all providers offer security cameras in their equipment packages. The commonest excuse for the deployment of CCTV cameras is in the prevention and detection of crime. Fire sprinklers utilize water by direct application onto flames and heat, which causes cooling of the combustion process and prevents ignition of adjacent combustibles. In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>Common exceptions to this rule are video surveillance systems used in patient care areas or for patient monitoring. Basically, this allows your Nest Cam IQ device to shoot videos with multiple exposures, then digitally combine the images to create a more true-to-life video. To fully secure your business and the safety of your employees, you may want to also look at access control, monitored alarm systems and fire alarms.</p>

Read our simple guide to burglar alarms and discover the pros and cons of a bells-only Vs a fully monitored system.

The EU's Data Protection Directive regulates access to personal data including CCTV recordings. For example the cost savings associated with crimes averted through camera systems in a city of USA saved over four dollars for every dollar spent on the technology, while another city yielded a 50 cent return on the dollar.</p>

Positions for camera installation: Cameras should be placed in appropriate areas to record relevant video.

<p>The most important characteristics of an effective burglar alarm system are its accuracy in identifying the correct alarm outputs to assure quick and correct responses and the unit's accuracy in communicating with the security service provider. From a practical perspective, wireless systems have more flexibility if you may move or don't want to put holes in walls. Most of our surveillance systems include DVR viewer software for Windows and Mac PCs, as well as mobile surveillance viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.</p>
