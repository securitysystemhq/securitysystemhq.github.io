Alternatively, your building's security system could consist of nothing more than a couple bubble cameras that only monitor hallways and office entries.</p>

Generally, home security systems involve two types, the indoor and outdoor alarm systems. Fire detectors can be heat, smoke or carbon monoxide sensors.

The disadvantage of smoke detectors is that they are usually more expensive to install, when compared to thermal sensors, and are more resistant to inadvertent alarms.</p>

The Blink XT2 video surveillance system lets small-business owners enjoy high-definition recording for less.</p>
