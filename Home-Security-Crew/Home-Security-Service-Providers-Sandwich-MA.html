<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>
