<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>Security definitions can be adapted to each intruder alarm control system, for an individual security policy. Under this range, we comprises Burglar Alarm System and Intrusion Alarm System. With a CCTV camera, you loose image quality every time you transfer the video from the analog signal when it is digitized in the cameras Digital Signal Processor, which is then converted back to analog to run up the coax cable, which is again digitized at the DVR for recording.</p>

<p>The addition of VIP significantly improves the usefulness of CCTV , particularly where there are a large number of cameras installed, which an operator cannot view at the same time. The control panel's microprocessor sends a constant interrogation signal over each circuit, in which each initiating device is contacted to inquire its status (normal or emergency). Plus prior to you actually testing the system you need to walk round the house to make sure that all doors and windows are closed.</p>
<p>Giving completely clear pictures is the main role of shrewd surveillance, so top quality picture catch is fundamental, so the data gave by the camera can be handled precisely. Outdoor PIR and dual technology motion detectors, commonly named WatchOUT detectors, are also being used as an important additional perimeter motion detector.
