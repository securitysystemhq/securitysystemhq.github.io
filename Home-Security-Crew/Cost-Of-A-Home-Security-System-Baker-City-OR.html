<p>LifeShield provides home security solutions for the DIY-er and individual who prefers professional installation. What this means is that the camera can be powered and transfer video feed all with one Cat5 cable, rather than running a power cable and a separate video cable the way that analog cameras do. Another perk of using IP CCTV cameras is that the resolution that can be achieved far surpasses the video quality that can be delivered while using analog technology.</p>
<p>Along these lines, in spite of the way that video is being transmitted from the cameras in a simple organization, live and recorded video is as yet accessible over the system. The most basic burglar alarm works with a simple electric circuit built into an entry door or window.

<p>The experimental results show that, based on the proposed intelligent smoke alarm system, the air condition can be more accurately distinguished, and the probability of false alarms is greatly reduced, so that the air information can be viewed in real time and the alarm information can be received in a timely manner. The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system.</p>
