<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>The wireless Minut alarm instead uses several sensors to track key risk-factors within the home. Your system can act as a hub for up to 119 smart home devices, and can be controlled via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more.

You can set this up to be only one component, such as an outdoor security camera, or your entire system can be run on solar power.</p>
