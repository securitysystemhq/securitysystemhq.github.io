These are most commonly seen in offices and other businesses, but can work effectively as a home security surveillance system as well.

<p>Service Providers can give their customer, the homeowner, the power to monitor and control many devices in the home: Thermostats, door locks, lighting, cameras - while at home or away. Intelligent intrusion detection is a delicate balance between responding to real security breaches and ignoring costly false alarm sources.

When one of these initiating devices is triggered, the control panel will go into an alarm state.
