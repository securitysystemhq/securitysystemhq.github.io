Not only do our intruder alarm systems act as a deterrent, they also provide a warning that an intrusion is taking place.</p>

Infrared surveillance cameras are used by government agencies such as the SWAT for tailing suspects at night.</p>

These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems. Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away. We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.</p>
