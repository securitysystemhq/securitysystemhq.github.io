Bottom Line: The Abode iota is an easy-to-install all-in-one security system loaded with features including a 1080p camera, a motion sensor, multiple wireless radios, a built-in siren, and support for many third-party devices and platforms.

The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm.
