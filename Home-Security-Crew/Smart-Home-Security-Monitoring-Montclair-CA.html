<p>With the continual increase in theft, burglary and vandalism, crime is something everyone thinks about. Bottom Line: The Abode iota is an easy-to-install all-in-one security system loaded with features including a 1080p camera, a motion sensor, multiple wireless radios, a built-in siren, and support for many third-party devices and platforms. When alarms go on and lights go out, people start pushing and shoving in order to escape the building. Drains should be properly installed to remove all water from the sprinkler system, and prevent water from leakage onto protected spaces, when piping service is necessary.</p>

Of course, with the large number of wireless systems that we offer, the amount of choices and options might seem overwhelming.

<p>All these sensors work in tandem with other sensors and the IP camera so that the central control device sends warnings and notifications to your smartphones. The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm. In one, New York City police in a helicopter supposedly monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared video camera on an amorous couple enjoying the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop balcony.</p>
