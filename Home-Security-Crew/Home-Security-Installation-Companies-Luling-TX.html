<p>Fire alarm systems are installed in commercial and residential buildings for the sole purpose to avoid fire and smoke. Learn more about professional installation services here. Zmodo offers Zmodo Cloud Service to store, share and playback your security camera's footage. After years of development, surveillance cameras can provide higher resolution images and clearer audio. Cameras should be mounted as close possible to the field of view required, and the closer the camera to the subject the better the identification of the subject will be.
