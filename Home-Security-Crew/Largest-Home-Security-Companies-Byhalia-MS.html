<p>Installing a CCTV camera can sometimes be difficult and sometimes be easy. A security alarm system does not really intend to help property owners or residents to catch thieves.

<p>As you did with the power cable; you will want to swap out your video cable with a secondary one to test if the cable has gone bad.
