<p>Burglar alarms were usually associated with stores or other businesses in the past, but over the past few years, more and more people chose to protect their homes with alarms as well. When installing wireless security cameras, keep in mind that the smart home camera you buy will only be as good as the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the location where you plan to install it. So before you drill holes in your walls or otherwise mess up your doorframe, brick or siding, check your Wi-Fi speed If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll notice significant lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other delays that make security cameras a pain to use.</p>

<p>IP video cameras operate by providing a video feed through your high-speed Internet connection. The alarm effectiveness depends on the type of zone being triggered, zone's number, time within a certain day, and other installed aspects in the monitoring scheme.
