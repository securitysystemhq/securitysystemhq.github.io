<p>It's hard to know just how important the right fire safety equipment will be unless you've been through a fire and have already experienced it. The fact is that the proper equipment can save lives. In reality it does not work that well, as extreme weather may often cause false alarms.

Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
