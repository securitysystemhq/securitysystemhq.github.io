<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>
<p>But when the door or window is opened by an intruder, the circuit will be open, thus the alarm will be triggered. A video surveillance camera can be used for other types of tests on cars. Hikvision products also provide powerful business intelligence for end users, which can enable more efficient operations and greater commercial success.
