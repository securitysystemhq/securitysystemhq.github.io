I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers.

Additionally, the cost of motion detector sensors, as well as special sensors that pick up on fire risks, high carbon monoxide levels, and even air conditioning problems, are very expensive.

<p>Safety is one thing you shouldn't compromise on and having a smoke & fire alarm installed at your home or office could mean the difference between life and death.
