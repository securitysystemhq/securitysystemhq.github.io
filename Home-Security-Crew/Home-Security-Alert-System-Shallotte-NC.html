<p>I admit that I am a bit of a nerd - I find survey data very interesting. Therefore, it is also often known as IP Camera or Network Camera. With the rate of how quickly technology improves in today's age, analog cameras are still very capable of delivering the convenience, safety, and security that consumers have come to expect at a lower cost than IP.

In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>

<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network.
