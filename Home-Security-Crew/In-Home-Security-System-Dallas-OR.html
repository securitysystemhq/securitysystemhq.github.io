<p>CCTV security cameras have come a long way since being first introduced into the market in the late 1960's. We deal in a wide assortment of products including video surveillance systems, time attendance system, finger print based time attendance system, card based time and attendance system, biometric (finger print) door lock, CCTV camera system, IR camera, night vision camera, networking multi-doors controller, box camera, PTZ dome camera, dome camera, heat detectors, PIR sensor, long distance inductive guard tour system and guard tour system for non-security personnel.</p>
<p>If a detector recognizes a condition which could be indicative of a fire, the control panel will first attempt a quick reset. Rather than initiating an alarm state, the control panel will go into a supervisory” state, if a sprinkler valve is in an off-normal” condition. Contract-free - Most DIY home security providers offer month-to-month options for video storage and professional monitoring. We also have a D-link Security camera which is somewhat cylindrical in shape and very lightweight.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>

<p>10. The Lowest Total Cost Of Ownership: When you compare the cost per camera, and the flexibility and performance a network camera gives you, it makes sense to go with the Network IP camera.
