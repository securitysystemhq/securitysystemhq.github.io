<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>Motion sensor lighting that detect movements and light up are a good option for outside as well as inside home spaces while garage and porch-areas also do well to have these installed; other options for improving home security include installing heat sensors that go off when they detect human body heat, so pet animals are not at risk of activating these. Home Security Systems is not a subject to be taken lightly.</p>

Monitoring Productivity - Many companies use multiple security cameras in breakrooms, on sales floors and in hallways to monitor employee productivity.</p>
<p>If the fire alarm system is addressable, the source of the occurrence will be pointed on the control panel. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Today, due to different technological advancements, video surveillance cameras are better than ever and can now be used with computers for more complex situations.</p>
