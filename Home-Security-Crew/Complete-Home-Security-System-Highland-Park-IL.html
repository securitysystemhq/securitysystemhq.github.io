<p>CCTV cameras also known as close circuit television have been a part of our lives since the year 1942 when they were first used by Siemens AG to observe the take-off of V2 rockets in Nazi Germany. They are small, portable, and can often be programmed so you can view surveillance footage via the internet, which means you can even check on your home while you're on vacation.

The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly—the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage).</p>

What this means is that the camera can be powered and transfer video feed all with one Cat5 cable, rather than running a power cable and a separate video cable the way that analog cameras do. Another perk of using IP CCTV cameras is that the resolution that can be achieved far surpasses the video quality that can be delivered while using analog technology.</p>
