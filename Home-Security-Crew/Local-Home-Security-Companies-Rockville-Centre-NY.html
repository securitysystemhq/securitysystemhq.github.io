<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Think of the alarm system connected to the door. Security cameras can keep an eye out for criminal activity, but they also give family members the ability to monitor the person and the home remotely. If there's one thing you can say for SimpliSafe, it's that it's cheap You'll pay way less for SimpliSafe sensors and equipment than you would for something like Vivint or ADT. You can also use QuietOpen, so you can let the dog out without a problem by only deactivating that one door, or you can select Pathlight motion sensors to light up as you move to help guide your way.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that's the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>
