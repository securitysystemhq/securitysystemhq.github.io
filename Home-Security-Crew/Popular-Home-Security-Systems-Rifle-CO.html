A CCTV unit will need to be installed by a professional, but if you own a very large property then the cost is definitely worth it. They can be placed both externally and internally and the DVR playback is easy and straightforward.</p>

Most security companies, whether they're DIY, professionally installed, professionally monitored, or self-monitored, will offer guidance if you're confused about what to choose. Program the Raspberry Pi to get the data from Arduino and when the motion is detected the camera should take a picture of the intruder and send a mail to the registered mail ID, if there is any gas leakage or inflammable gas detected or there is smoke in the industry you can actuate the exhaust fan, and you can monitor the smooth operation of any machine with the vibration sensor.</p>
