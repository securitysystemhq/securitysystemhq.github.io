<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>Swansea University has installed a network of Advanced fire alarm control panels to protect its 65-acre, £450million Bay campus from the threat of fire. Large chain retailers as well as many small business owners use video surveillance equipment as their first line of defense against theft and vandalism.
