<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
<p>Smart home automation features for a more robust security system. Fire-alarm control panels (FACP) or fire-alarm control units (FACU) consist of electric panels that function as the controlling components of a fire-alarm system Figure 9.35).
