<p>CCTV cameras are extensively used in organizations, institutions, shopping malls, banks, casinos, airports and homes and have become an indispensable security tool for scrutinizing people and activities. To better understand the mechanism by which daily RM reduced all-cause and CV mortality in IN-TIME, Hindricks et al. 44 recently performed an individual patient meta-analysis (Truecoin) of three Home Monitoring trials: TRUST, ECOST, and IN-TIME (Table 1 ). The composite CV endpoints combining CV- or all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization, and the composite WHF endpoints combining WHF- or all-cause mortality and WHF hospitalization were analysed.</p>
<p>Bullet Cameras: Bullet security cameras are a type video surveillance camera that are typically small and shaped like a rifle bullet shell or lipstick case. Monitoring employees using employee video surveillance can be a high risk, high reward situation for an employer.
