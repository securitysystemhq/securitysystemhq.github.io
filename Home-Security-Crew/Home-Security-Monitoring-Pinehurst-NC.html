If you have an Xfinity X1 cable TV box, you can control the system from there and watch live video from the camera. We specialize in providing an extensive range of CCTV cameras, and performing research and development in Camera DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for other renowned manufacturers.

And by recording a wide 180-degree view whenever its motion sensor or mic are triggered, the DCS-2530L does its job quite well.</p>
