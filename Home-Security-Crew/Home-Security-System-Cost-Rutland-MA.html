The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras.

The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm.
