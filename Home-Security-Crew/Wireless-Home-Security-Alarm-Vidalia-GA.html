<p>Fire alarms are important security devices which help to seek protection against fire accidents. If you have an Xfinity X1 cable TV box, you can control the system from there and watch live video from the camera. We specialize in providing an extensive range of CCTV cameras, and performing research and development in Camera DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for other renowned manufacturers.

<p>This can help to prevent numerous false alarms that a smoke detector may produce. Analog camera systems are affordable and can be sufficient for remote monitoring depending on the application. TP-Link offers a robust outdoor camera with cloud storage for under $100. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app.</p>
