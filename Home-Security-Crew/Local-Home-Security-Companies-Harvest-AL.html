Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>

When you use a company with live monitoring services, you may get several interconnected command centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.
