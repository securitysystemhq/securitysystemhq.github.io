<p>CCTV cameras are extensively used in organizations, institutions, shopping malls, banks, casinos, airports and homes and have become an indispensable security tool for scrutinizing people and activities. To better understand the mechanism by which daily RM reduced all-cause and CV mortality in IN-TIME, Hindricks et al. 44 recently performed an individual patient meta-analysis (Truecoin) of three Home Monitoring trials: TRUST, ECOST, and IN-TIME (Table 1 ). The composite CV endpoints combining CV- or all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization, and the composite WHF endpoints combining WHF- or all-cause mortality and WHF hospitalization were analysed.</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
