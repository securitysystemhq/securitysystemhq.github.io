Several techniques to protect the privacy of individuals have therefore been proposed, but very little research work has focused on the specific security requirements of video surveillance data (in transit or in storage) and on authorizing access to this data.</p>

What happens when your alarm goes off will largely depend on the kind of security system you have installed. The main advantage of dry pipe sprinkler systems is their ability to provide automatic protection in spaces where freezing is possible.</p>
<p>Our top pick for small-business video monitoring systems is Frontpoint—mostly because Frontpoint doesn't just provide high-definition cameras. Alder does not have a selection of pre-made packages you can choose from, but works with customers to build out security systems that are best for their homes. In more complex buildings such as retail premises, where the evacuation system is based on staged or phased evacuation, or where people are unfamiliar with the fire warning arrangements, the landlord or employer might consider installing a voice evacuation system.</p>
