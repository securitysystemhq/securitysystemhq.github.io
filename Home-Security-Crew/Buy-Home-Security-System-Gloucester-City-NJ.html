The high cost associated with the installation and maintenance of home security systems is the key factor limiting the growth of this market. Gone are the days when only business owners relied on monitoring systems to protect their property. A wireless burglar alarm system can be easily expanded to include additional motion sensors and other peripherals (smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, driveway and pool sensors, motion activated lights, etc.). A hard-wired system may be limited to the number of peripherals offered by a particular service.</p>
