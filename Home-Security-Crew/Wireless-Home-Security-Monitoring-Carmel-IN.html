<p>All Ring Alarm Security Kits include a free 30-day trial of Ring Protect Plus. Smart device integration: If you have a home full of smart devices, consider looking for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that includes a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or‚Äîeventually a Thread‚Äîradio that can connect them.

<p>The computerized logic of the control panel analyzes multiple detectors at the same time to decide on the most appropriate course of action. Smart fire alarm systems can perform integrated automatic actions, for example, discharge fire-suppression systems in closed designated areas; and vary the notifications to support people on their way out, while protecting expensive electronic equipment inside.
