<p>There are many things that homeowners can do to improve their home security. 3. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, said optical system comprising a pair of lenses and a pair of prisms arranged to direct said light beams to a particular point, a photo-cell arranged to receive said light beams and convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photo-cell and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>The development of web-based systems from the evolution of the new APIs, and from the new languages based on the web 2.0 generation are also bringing improvements for intruder alarm systems.
