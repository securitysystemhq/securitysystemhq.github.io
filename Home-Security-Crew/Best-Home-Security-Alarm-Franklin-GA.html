<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>

<p>To prevent this eventuality, ARC's are required to receive two alarm events within a certain timeframe to initiate a Police response. Today; however, reliable home security companies have come to realize that an audible alarm is sometimes simply not enough to completely eliminate the threat of a home invasion. Associating DVR systems along with CCTV security cameras is a brilliant idea but cabling complexities and the problem of managing of the cables will always be there.</p>
<p>Before these updates, in the event of an alarm, the alphanumeric display at the control panel indicated which zone was affected — something like Fire Alarm — Zone 6, East Wing Third Floor.” With an addressable head system; however, the exact location is pinpointed.
