<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>You may have to pay more for packages that come with smart home devices and capabilities. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered. Other systems using infrared technology detect motion in a room and set off an alarm. Stream live video and talk to anyone inside your home with our HD indoor security camera.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that's the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>

<p>All the components of the system are interconnected using many cameras for critical sites, by means of IP mega pixel cameras. There are two types of security cameras systems, Analog and IP (sometimes refered to as network cameras). Analog cameras: These are usually lower resolution than the more modern IP technology, and require cable connections to a DVR to record and store footage, plus wired connections for power.</p>
<p>H.264 compression is a form of video compression that allows the DVR to capture video from the camera and store it on the hard drive inside. Often deemed to be a security essential, these systems are a universal fixture of most premises.
