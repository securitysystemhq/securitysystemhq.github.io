<p>These can be fitted with timers so that they come on only during the night, and using low-energy bulbs makes them very inexpensive to leave on. You will have full colour images all night and even if you need to buy several lights it will likely be far less expensive than a camera with infra-red capability. All they need is access to the IP camera's network via the Internet. If your alarm is set and your home security is breached your alarm system will automatically and immediately send a distress signal to the monitoring company.</p>
<p>It also supports Zigbee and Z-Wave, which means you can connect the system to a wide variety of third-party devices so you can control everything from within the Abode app. When choosing a home security system it is important to look for one that offers 24-hour a day, 7 day a week monitoring that is completely uninterrupted.
