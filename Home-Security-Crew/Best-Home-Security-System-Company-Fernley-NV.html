<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
