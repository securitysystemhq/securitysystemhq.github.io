IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

Past statistics on crimes show that the more noticeable and better technology the camera systems are, the more it helps in preventing criminal activities in business or residential buildings 6 Factors that are necessary for an outdoor camera are: they should be weather- resistant, and should include night vision even in well-lit locations.</p>
<p>Our top pick for small-business video monitoring systems is Frontpoint—mostly because Frontpoint doesn't just provide high-definition cameras. Alder does not have a selection of pre-made packages you can choose from, but works with customers to build out security systems that are best for their homes.
