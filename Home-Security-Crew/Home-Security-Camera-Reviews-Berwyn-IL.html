<p>It's hard to know just how important the right fire safety equipment will be unless you've been through a fire and have already experienced it. The fact is that the proper equipment can save lives. In reality it does not work that well, as extreme weather may often cause false alarms. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm. Although the controlling is done automatically when the sensors detect the change in the environment, you can also control the project using the android app or through the webaddress.</p>
<p>Whether you're at the office or away on vacation, our state of the art home security cameras and monitors keep you and your family safe.

It makes high-end equipment, it offers a bunch of smart home devices, and it's ahead of the curve when it comes to innovative features. Perhaps this is no better demonstrated than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had changed since he took on the role in 2014, with the growth of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more.</p>
