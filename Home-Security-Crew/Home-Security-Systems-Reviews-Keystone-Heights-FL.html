Electronic security systems that connect to phone lines are offered by telephone monitoring services that respond to calls. If people know that there are cameras around them, they will most likely not do anything stupid. Connect video cables to the DVR video in ports.</p>
<p>These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components. If smoke rises beyond the permissible limits, it sends an alarm to the control panel.
