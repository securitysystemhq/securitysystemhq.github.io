In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. Professional monitoring gives you peace of mind during an alarm, no matter where you are. Add sensors using your phone's camera by scanning the QR code present behind the sensor.
