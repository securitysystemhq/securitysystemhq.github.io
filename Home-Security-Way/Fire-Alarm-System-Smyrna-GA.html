<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted.
