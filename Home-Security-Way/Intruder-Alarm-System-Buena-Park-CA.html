<p>The Fire Prevention Division is a group of firefighters who are the ones that go around to buildings and do a fire alarm inspection and other kinds of building checks.

CCTV relies on strategic placement of cameras, and observation of the camera's input on monitors somewhere. As tempting as it might be, avoid any of the too-good-to-be-true” security cameras from companies like Geeni or brandless devices available en masse on Amazon.</p>
<p>Most of these cameras transfer the signal wirelessly. In a world of smart devices, this smoke detector is fairly basic. The added advantage of wireless technology means servicing your wireless security alarm system can be done easily without the need to check metres of physical wiring.

<p>A fire ignition in one of the rooms monitored by zone "A" causes a smoke detector to go into alarm. If this type of smoke detector goes into alarm it will trigger the alarm and sound the horn or siren that is connected to it. If the system is monitored the authorities will be notified.
