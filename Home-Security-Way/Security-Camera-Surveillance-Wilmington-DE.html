They can perform all the functions of a digital video recorder mentioned above and adds support for IP and megapixel cameras. Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services. Fire safety begins with fire detection, and fire detection means everything from components—sensors, initiating devices, annunciators, and control panels—to integrated systems.</p>
<p>Many residents and businesses are now utilizing surveillance cameras and these cameras may capture persons and events without the owner's knowledge and this captured information may help the police department solve crimes and help keep the Borough safe. The Smonet outdoor security camera is equipped with night vision, wide-angle lens and 720p HD video quality.
