Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it.
