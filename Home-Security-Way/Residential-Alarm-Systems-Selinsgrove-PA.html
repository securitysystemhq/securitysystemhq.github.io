Currently, Ring Alarm and the professional monitoring service are available only within the U.S. (excluding American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada (excluding Quebec). Video surveillance cameras have two main types of connections: wired or wireless. Burglar alarm circuits are constructed in a similar manner, other than the fact that instead on flipping a switch, the alarm's circuits are completed when it detects an intrusion like a breaking of a window, or opening a door, when it is activated.</p>
