<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>

Preaction and drypipe systems may require additional effort to reset control equipment. Thermal detectors are similar to our ability to identify high temperatures, smoke detectors replicate the sense of smell, and flame detectors are electronic eyes.
