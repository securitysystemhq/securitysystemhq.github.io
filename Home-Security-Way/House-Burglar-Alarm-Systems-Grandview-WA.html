<p>With home security monitoring systems, you can have trained professionals monitor your home 24 hours a day, seven days a week from interconnected command centers. In an open-circuit system, the circuit completes when the alarm is triggered. It can include observing from assistance through an electronic device like CCTV cameras (Closed-circuit television) or by keeping a track on electronically transmitted information like on phone calls & internet traffic.</p>
<p>Motion sensing cameras can send an alert to your security company or your smartphone app when they are triggered, allowing you to get a feed just at the moment you need it, rather than all the time. A:Most companies do not give a lot of time when the alarm is first activated to when you personally disarm it.
