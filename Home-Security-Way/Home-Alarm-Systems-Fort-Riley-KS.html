<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>No, not all providers offer security cameras in their equipment packages. The commonest excuse for the deployment of CCTV cameras is in the prevention and detection of crime. Fire sprinklers utilize water by direct application onto flames and heat, which causes cooling of the combustion process and prevents ignition of adjacent combustibles. In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>Unlike competitors that focus purely on security, Abode Iota also serves as a smart home controller. Those who prefer to get hold of the wired versions may need to put in considerable amount of work as the installation of these wired security systems entail wiring positioning and drilling of holes. Expect to pay more for a security camera with features like rugged outdoor housing and crisp night time vision.</p>

However, if your camera has a narrow viewing angle but a wide pan tilt, you may be fine to scale back your number of cameras (as long as you frequently pan the cameras to take in every corner of the room).</p>
