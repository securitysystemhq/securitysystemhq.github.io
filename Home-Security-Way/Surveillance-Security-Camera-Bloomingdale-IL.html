<p>With the different purposes of surveillance cameras, there is also a need for different types of these cameras in order to accomplish certain purposes. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes.

<p>Regardless of the size of your home, or the number of doors and windows or interior rooms a homeowner decides to protect, the only real difference is in the number of security components deployed throughout the home and monitored by the control panel.

This monitoring service charges $39 per month and equipment costs $499. The average buyer won't know much about the options available or how burglar alarm sensors work, so in this section we will cover both of these points.

Reviewers also praised the ease of use of the key fobs and the ability to disable individual sensors, so you can do things like step out of the back door without setting off the alarm, while still being alerted if someone tries to break down the front door.</p>
<p>For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator. An addressable fire alarm system is made up of a series of fire detectors and devices that are connected back to a central control panel.</p>
