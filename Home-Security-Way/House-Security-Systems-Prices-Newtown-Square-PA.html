<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters.

By linking them with police control room, on the event of robbery or theft, the alarm will self-operate and send a message to the nearby PCR vans.</p>
<p>More recently, decentralized IP cameras , perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation. It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.
