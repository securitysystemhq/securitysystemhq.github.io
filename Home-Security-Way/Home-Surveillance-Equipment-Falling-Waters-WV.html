<p>The company wanted to create a comprehensive security device without using wi-fi-connected cameras, which are controversial but increasingly common thanks to product families like the Google-owned Nest and Amazon's Ring. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

It allows users to remotely store, manage, record, play, and monitor surveillance footage entirely on the cloud or on secure servers.</p>

<p>There are also systems which monitor the battery levels for your alarm system and notify you when the battery is low and needs to be changed. Indoor cameras can be part of a complete home security system, or used on their own to add extra protection to your home and your loved ones. Vibration sensors are those that are usually positioned in windows that may be tripped when these devices moves back and forth, thermal sensors give out false alarms when the temperature of the surrounding environment abruptly changes, extra receptive motion sensors may possibly identify animal movements within your dwelling and launch false alarms.</p>
<p>Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
