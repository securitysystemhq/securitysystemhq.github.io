<p>Many cities, businesses, and individuals have installed Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras for surveillance purposes. The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>
<p>The Firex is easy to install and can be interconnected with other alarms to create a full-house smoke detection system. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees. The basic plan provides users with three wireless door sensors and one wireless motion sensor. Optex aims at providing products and services to our customers in the fields of security detectors, access control, and industrial equipment, as well as transportation-related and LED lighting control systems.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>

Most fire alarms provide information about where the fire is located to emergency responders. Outdoor cameras are one of the best ways to deter (and catch) burglars, vandals, and other miscreants.</p>
<p>Although a proposed ordinance requiring all establishments with liquor licenses to install cameras that feed into the monitoring center was abandoned in the face of opposition, several bars accused of violating liquor laws have entered consent decrees with the city's Alcoholic Beverage Control board, requiring them to do just that. If you get a camera with a narrow viewing angle, you should consider getting more cameras to monitor every area of your business.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the motorized cameras are HDCVI or IP cameras, or whether your recorder is a DVR, XVR, or NVR, the cameras can be controlled using the friendly GUI interface of our systems as shown in the following video.
