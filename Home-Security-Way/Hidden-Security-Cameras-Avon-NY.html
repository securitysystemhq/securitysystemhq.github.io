<p>One of the most important lessons preschool children must be taught is fire prevention and safety. This may include motion-sensing devices that alert you when it detects motion. In addition, the marriage of MNS and fire alarm control systems is a growing trend that it is hoped will continue and be applied in larger varieties of facilities and multibuilding properties, including schools, high-rise buildings, mass transit hubs, and even public gathering places such as theatres, restaurants, and places of worship.</p>
