They can perform all the functions of a digital video recorder mentioned above and adds support for IP and megapixel cameras. Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services. Fire safety begins with fire detection, and fire detection means everything from components—sensors, initiating devices, annunciators, and control panels—to integrated systems.</p>
<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it. The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>The ADT app makes controlling your home security simple and intuitive with our interface. Boasting 360-degree continuous pan range, and -5 to 90-degree or more tilt range, the speed dome series thermal cameras can automatically track targets in thermal and optical channels simultaneously when an alarm is triggered. There are new and advanced CCTV mega-pixel cameras available which can take 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution images of the camera scene either on a time lapse or motion detection basis.</p>

Video surveillance security cameras protect your employees both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p>Few other home security providers will allow customers to connect security systems from other providers, or offer such a wide-ranging choice of plans, including custom solutions, but ADT does. These fire alarm systems are identical to an L3 system but with additional detection in an area where there is a high chance of ignition (e.g., kitchen) or where the risk to people is particularly increased (e.g., sleeping risk).</p>
