<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make.

The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
