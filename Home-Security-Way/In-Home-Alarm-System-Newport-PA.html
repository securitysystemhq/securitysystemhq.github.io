Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Vivint wireless security camera systems can be outfitted with motion sensor technology that is both energy-efficient and more secure. Presently, sophisticated burglar alarm ranging from miniature, self-contained noisemakers, to intricate, multi-zoned systems having color-coded computer monitor outputs are available. They receive a signal from a fire sensor (smoke, heat or carbon monoxide detector) and automatically transmit it to the fire alarm panel.</p>
<p>If communication with one home monitoring center is interrupted, the other centers takes over quickly, giving them the ability to offer continuous security through the company's advanced alarm monitoring service - providing clients with increased safety and peace of mind. Subsequently, thermal detectors are usually not permitted in life safety applications. Due to the high cost of crash tests, these cameras are invaluable in helping researchers obtain as much data as possible from the test.</p>
