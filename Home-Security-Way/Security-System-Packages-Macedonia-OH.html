They'll record video when the doorbell is pressed or when motion is detected, and usually offer two-way audio communication that allows you to speak with the visitor from anywhere via your phone.</p>
<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems.
