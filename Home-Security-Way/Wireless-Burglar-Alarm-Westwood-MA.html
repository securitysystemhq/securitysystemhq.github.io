This means when your alarm is activated and your monitoring company gets the signal, they will try to call the location to cancel the alarm.

For one, cameras should avoid or mask inappropriate views of private areas, such as yards and windows of bedrooms or washrooms. This gives you better image quality, flexibility and scalability in a lower cost to operate than traditional CCTV cameras.</p>
