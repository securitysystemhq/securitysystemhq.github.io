Plus, most of these DIY systems are wireless, which is great for renters who can't drill holes in the wall.</p>
<p>As well as sounding an alarm, such sensors can easily be a part of a burglar alarm with text or phone alerts. Availability of low cost cameras and ease of installation are important factors for growth of DIY cameras.
