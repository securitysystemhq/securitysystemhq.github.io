<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>The fire alarm system must communicate with and control its system components and it must also communicate with offsite facilities and organizations such as the fire department and emergency services. Program Arduino to sense the data from all the three sensors and send these data to raspberry pi through serial communication.
