<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. Professional monitoring gives you peace of mind during an alarm, no matter where you are. Add sensors using your phone's camera by scanning the QR code present behind the sensor.

The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device.
