<p>Wireless internet CCTV cameras, also known as wireless IP cameras, are the digital replacement for traditional analogue CCTV. From video collection only, to multi-dimensional data awareness: A Huawei Software Defined Camera (SDC) — with a full hardware series available, designed for diverse scenarios — converges cloud IoT data with media and information networks, to realize 360° awareness of people, vehicles, objects, the environment, and behaviors, mining multi-dimensional data for true value, and promising to comprehensively safeguard cities.</p>
<p>If the intruder opens the door, the circuit breaks and triggers the alarm. It has been noticed that, IP Storage Area Network is gaining traction over digital and network video recorders for storage as it proposes enhanced scalability, retention and huge storage capacity.
