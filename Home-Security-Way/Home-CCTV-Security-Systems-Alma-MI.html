<p>A fire alarm is a fire safety device that is utilised to alert the public about a fire outbreak.

<h2>Home Security System Packages Alma Michigan</h2>

These can be photoelectric smoke and heat detectors, ionization smoke detectors, heat detectors, in-duct smoke detectors, manually operated pull stations and sprinkler waterflow sensors.</p>
<p>In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary.
