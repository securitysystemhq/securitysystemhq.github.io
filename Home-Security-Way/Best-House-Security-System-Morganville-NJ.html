The fact is that the proper equipment can save lives. In reality it does not work that well, as extreme weather may often cause false alarms. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm.

A basic intruder alarm system consists of a control panel, with rechargeable battery power backup and internal or external keypads, several interior and perimeter intrusion detectors, and one external sounder, at least.</p>
