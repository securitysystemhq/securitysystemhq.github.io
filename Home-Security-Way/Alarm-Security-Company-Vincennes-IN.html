End Your Interlace Issues:When you move to a Network IP camera, you get rid of the interlace problem with moving video.

A fire alarm system can vary dramatically in both price and complexity, from a single panel with a detector and sounder in a small commercial property to an addressable fire alarm system in a multi-occupancy building.</p>
<p>Before these updates, in the event of an alarm, the alphanumeric display at the control panel indicated which zone was affected — something like Fire Alarm — Zone 6, East Wing Third Floor.” With an addressable head system; however, the exact location is pinpointed. Many people don't realize how easy and convenient it can be to control their alarm system from their phone.

This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems.
