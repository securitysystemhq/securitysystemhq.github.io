This is based on user preference, but many security systems are most commonly controlled by a smartphone app, so often times it is sufficient (and easier for guests) to just have a keypad and then utilize the app for controlling the system on a day-to-day basis. But if you have an alarm, get into the habit of using it every time you leave the house.</p>
