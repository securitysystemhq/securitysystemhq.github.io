This is based on user preference, but many security systems are most commonly controlled by a smartphone app, so often times it is sufficient (and easier for guests) to just have a keypad and then utilize the app for controlling the system on a day-to-day basis. But if you have an alarm, get into the habit of using it every time you leave the house.</p>
<p>Our goal at Kisi is to have a seamless security experience; therefore, we understand why organizations want to have a burglar alarm system running in conjunction with the Kisi system.
