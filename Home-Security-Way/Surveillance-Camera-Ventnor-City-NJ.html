<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>CCTV Camera Pros has simple fixed lens models as well as high end varifocal cameras with sens-up, WDR, and on screen display controls. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers."

<p>The best home security systems use tools and technology to help keep you, your family, and your property safe. These systems consist of a central control panel to which smoke alarms and heat detectors are connected, along with bells or horns that are activated when the system triggers an alarm. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night.</p>

Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring technologies have also become something of a focus for the tech device industry. The standard does not require the use of heat detectors as part of the basic protection scheme, but it recommends that heat detectors be used to supplement the basic smoke detector system. Add cameras to a network before they even arrive, and adjust both optical and software settings remotely. By having an IP Address, the camera can be integrated easily with existing network infrastructure.</p>

<p>Dome CCTV cameras. As you will be installing a very large system of CCTV cameras, there will be some inconvenience with respect to the length of the cable.
