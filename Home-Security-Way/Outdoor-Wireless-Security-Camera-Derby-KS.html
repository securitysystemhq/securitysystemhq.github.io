Indoor cameras can be part of a complete home security system, or used on their own to add extra protection to your home and your loved ones. Vibration sensors are those that are usually positioned in windows that may be tripped when these devices moves back and forth, thermal sensors give out false alarms when the temperature of the surrounding environment abruptly changes, extra receptive motion sensors may possibly identify animal movements within your dwelling and launch false alarms.</p>
<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that, based on the proposed intelligent smoke alarm system, the air condition can be more accurately distinguished, and the probability of false alarms is greatly reduced, so that the air information can be viewed in real time and the alarm information can be received in a timely manner. The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system.</p>
