<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>An alarm user shall not be fined more than $200 for false alarms that occur at the same premises in any 24-hour period.

Generally, home security systems involve two types, the indoor and outdoor alarm systems. Fire detectors can be heat, smoke or carbon monoxide sensors.

Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems.</p>
<p>In the ionization detector, if the smoke particle enters the chamber of the ionization detector it will reduce air ionization inside the chamber of the ionization detector and triggers the alarm. Smart Vest uses wireless transmission from textile to a remote web server whereas LOBIN uses wireless transmission boards and distribution points in remote areas.
