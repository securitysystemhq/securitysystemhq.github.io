<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

<p>Software Description: Body cameras are now essential during police and traffic enforcement, and Body Camera Assistant software is a configuration tool designed for Hikvision body cameras. Today, alarm systems have advanced even further. Flame detectors must be looking directly at the fire source, unlike thermal and smoke detectors which can identify migrating fire signatures. A digital video surveillance camera - allows you to minimize number of false alarms.</p>
<p>The control panel performs supervisory functions over the initiating devices, indicating appliances, all associated field wiring, telephone ties, and its own internal wiring and circuit cards. Professional installation services may cost up to $250, although special offers that waive installation fees are common. However, if your camera has a narrow viewing angle but a wide pan tilt, you may be fine to scale back your number of cameras (as long as you frequently pan the cameras to take in every corner of the room).</p>
