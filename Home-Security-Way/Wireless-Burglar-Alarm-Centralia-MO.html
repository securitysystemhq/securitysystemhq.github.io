<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

Today, alarm systems have advanced even further. Flame detectors must be looking directly at the fire source, unlike thermal and smoke detectors which can identify migrating fire signatures. A digital video surveillance camera - allows you to minimize number of false alarms.</p>

Professional installation services may cost up to $250, although special offers that waive installation fees are common. However, if your camera has a narrow viewing angle but a wide pan tilt, you may be fine to scale back your number of cameras (as long as you frequently pan the cameras to take in every corner of the room).</p>
