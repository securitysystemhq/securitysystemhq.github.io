<p>So you're interested in purchasing a CCTV camera for either home security or for commercial use, but you don't know what type of camera to purchase? For microcontroller MC2 , keypad is connected to port 1 and LCD display is connected to port 2 and motor driver is connected to pins P1.2 and P1.3 and touch sensor is connected to pin P1.4. Motion detector is connected to pin P3.3 and taken as a input interrupt (INT1) to the microcontroller 2.
