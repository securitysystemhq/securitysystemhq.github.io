<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks.

The SSP Fire Detection and Alarm System (FDAS) meets the strict EN54 safety standards. They are more flexible as compared to earlier analog VHS tape systems and allow easier transmission of video over a computer network.</p>
<p>That competition has nudged third-party operators to step up their technology to the point where their technology and training can stack up against just about any in-house monitoring service. Manufacturers offer different types of cameras like fixed camera, bullet camera, dome camera, infrared camera, wireless security camera, spy camera and more.

Today; however, reliable home security companies have come to realize that an audible alarm is sometimes simply not enough to completely eliminate the threat of a home invasion.
