  <meta name="description" content="Home Security Monitoring in Smithfield Rhode Island - On the plus side is the fact that you have a visible deterrent to would-be burglars, and the alarm going off may stop a burglar getting in or cut down the time he stays around if he does get in. There may also be advantages in protecting a window with a burglar alarm rather than a lock so that you can get out quickly in case of fire.">
