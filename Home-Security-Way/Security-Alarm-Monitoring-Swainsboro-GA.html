In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, said optical system comprising a pair of lenses and a pair of prisms arranged to direct said light beams to a particular point, a photo-cell arranged to receive said light beams and convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photo-cell and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The cameras perform different functions depending on the type of surveillance system being used. They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it.
