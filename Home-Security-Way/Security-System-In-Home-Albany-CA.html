<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. There may be no way to avoid the occasional angry or unstable customer, disgruntled employee, parent, violent intruder or disturbed individual, but the installation of a panic system is a great way to mitigate the danger and prepare for it. Wired and wireless solutions from IntraLogic Solutions offer efficient and affordable options, and in many cases leverage existing technology as ready initiating devices.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>We even ensure to provide after sales services for these high definition household CCTV cameras. This monitoring equipment alerts the operator when the monitor must be viewed. Not only that but if your monitored security system is linked through to the police then three false strikes can mean you'll be struck off their register and they won't attend any future alerts. Not only can surveillance cameras deter criminals and help law enforcement quickly catch any would-be thieves, but these systems can also improve the accountability of your employees, help you monitor productivity and sometimes even reduce your insurance premiums.</p>
