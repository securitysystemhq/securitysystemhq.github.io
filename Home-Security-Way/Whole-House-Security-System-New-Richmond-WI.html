It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery. The system used for a linear burglar alarm is built on an unreceptive detection technique by means of infrared device, radio frequency reception and transmission and human-engineered digital electronic apparatus.</p>
<p>Unlike Frontpoint, Vivint requires professional installation and doesn't offer a DIY option.
