Bottom Line: The Abode iota is an easy-to-install all-in-one security system loaded with features including a 1080p camera, a motion sensor, multiple wireless radios, a built-in siren, and support for many third-party devices and platforms.

Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation. When motion (or sound) is detected, the Arlo Pro can send smartphone notifications or emails, turn on a siren built into the indoor Base Station, record video clips, or do nothing.</p>

Take it to the next level with IFTTT recipes to automate with other smart home compatible devices. Easy re-installation - If you need to reposition sensors or cameras, it's easy. ADT has plans other than Pulse that don't offer so many smart home features, and we really don't recommend them.</p>

There are a few other questions you might want to consider before you select your burglar alarm system.

So make sure you have gone through the images and types of cameras so that you pick the right option and not go just for the sake of low priced options. Most alarm systems now have a built in power back up system. It is surprising to realize how many people think the fire alarm systems are installed exclusively in corporate buildings and businesses.</p>
<p>Many security systems can add on additional security features such as infrared and sound-wave sensors. Some fully-monitored home security systems also notify your security provider's monitoring center of motion-triggered activity. Therefore, in a business environment I want my cameras highly visible, and if possible I want a big color monitor where all my patrons can see that I have the entire facility under surveillance, including them, and that the pictures are sharp, in color, and with a close enough view to make identification undeniable.</p>
