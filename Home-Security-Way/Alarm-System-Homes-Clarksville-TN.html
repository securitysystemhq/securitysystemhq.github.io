While the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution offers some protection against video searches conducted by the police, there are currently no general, legally enforceable rules to limit privacy invasions and protect against abuse of CCTV systems.

With a network camera you have an established IP address, giving you clear digital pictures with no loss of quality.
