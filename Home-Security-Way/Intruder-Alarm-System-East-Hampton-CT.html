In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting 65 light across said opening, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a photo-cell arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, said optical system comprising two mirrors 701 adapted to deflect said light beams onto said photo-cell, a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage and means responsive to the varying voltage to operate an alarm system.</p>
<p>But when the door or window is opened by an intruder, the circuit will be open, thus the alarm will be triggered. A video surveillance camera can be used for other types of tests on cars. Hikvision products also provide powerful business intelligence for end users, which can enable more efficient operations and greater commercial success.
