<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors , and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations. Ring also offers other home security products like an Alarm Flood & Freeze Sensor, Panic Alarm, and a Smoke and CO Listener, while exterior security can be boosted with the company's new range of smart lights While you will pay a small monthly fee ($10) for professional monitoring, the Ring Alarm Security Kit is the perfect choice for value hunters.</p>
