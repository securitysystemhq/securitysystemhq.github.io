<p>Eurovigil Security Solution, considered as India's most advanced electronic security system, is a part of the Eureka Forbes family. While the cost of installing and maintaining a home security system may make you question proceeding with the installation (BTW, you may need the top 4 tips to save money when buying a security camera system ), the proven effectiveness of deterring break-ins, coupled with the amount of money the system could save you in the long run (not to mention the peace of mind it will provide,) is certainly worth the expense.</p>
<p>Also, many of these systems can integrate with other smart-home devices, such as thermostats, locks, and light bulbs. With support for over 2,500 security camera models and related encoders-plus virtualization, centralization, and integration with the most popular access control systems-our video surveillance solutions provide a wide range of benefits to meet your organization's video security demands. Apart from homes and business premises, security cameras have many other applications; they can be used in different places to monitor and prevent criminal activities.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>
