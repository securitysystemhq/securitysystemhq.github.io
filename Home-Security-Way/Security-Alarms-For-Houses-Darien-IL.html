<p>Initially, fire alarm systems are designed to detect any element associated with fires. Modern line detectors are very stable and false alarms caused by animal motion, rain, fog or snow have been eliminated. Conspicuously placed cameras have been proven to reduce threats of violence and vandalism at businesses dramatically. It uses Z-Wave enabled devices to make it easy for you to automate lights, locks, thermostats, and more—no matter which level of monitoring you select.

<p>Wireless security alarms make installation easier and they look better too. There are different types of flame detectors for detecting different types of fires, such as petrol, diesel fuel, kerosene, paraffin, paint, solvent and propane fires.
