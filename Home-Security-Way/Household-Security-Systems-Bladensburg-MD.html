<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>Depending on the anticipated fire scenario, building and use type, number and type of occupants, and criticality of contents and mission, these systems can provide several main functions. Arm and disarm your home security system, view live video feeds, lock or unlock your doors, and even adjust your smart thermostat directly from your phone. ADT (US), Moni (US), Honeywell (US), Securitas (Sweden), UTC (US), Schneider (France), Johnson Controls (US), Vivint (US), Vector Security (US), and Bosch (Germany) are some of the major companies dominating the alarm monitoring market.</p>
<p>The new and improved Brinks Home Security uses MONI monitoring and Livewatch DIY security systems for a more modern package. There are typically two options for adding video surveillance: Pay a fee to have an alarm company install, monitor and respond to video alerts, or purchase a video surveillance system from a retail store and install it yourself. Video cameras can also help you sell more products from your retail store.</p>

After the control panel receives a signal for an initiating device and goes into an alarm state, the panel initiates output devices that signal to building occupants that there is an emergency situation.</p>
<p>These cameras are not always distinguishable from conventional security cameras, however the brand name FLIR is often a tell-tale sign that the camera is capable of thermal imaging. Axis AX is a complete system of high performance fire panels, audio systems, command centres and high performance devices. Simple home security devices such as locks on doors(deadbolts are best) and windows, bars, grates-items that are visible from the exterior of the house will not only act as a deterrent but slow down an intruder should he decide to try to enter.</p>
