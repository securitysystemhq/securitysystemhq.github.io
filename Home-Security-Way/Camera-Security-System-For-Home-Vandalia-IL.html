<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

<p>The base unit itself can detect motion and sound, and when its smart sensors are triggered it can record in 1080 HD video.

If smoke rises beyond the permissible limits, it sends an alarm to the control panel.

Privacy and hacking risks - Your DIY home security system will most likely connect to your home's router or Wi-Fi to monitor your home and send mobile alerts, but this also makes it easier for hackers to steal information if you're not careful.</p>
