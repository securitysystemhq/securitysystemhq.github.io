Finally, let us know your ZIP code and we'll make sure that ADT professional monitoring services are available in your area. If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately.</p>
<p>The sensors are typically placed in doors that lead to and from a house as well as easily accessible windows, particularly any that open, especially those at ground level. Smoke information classification solves the problem of low accuracy of traditional smoke alarms.
