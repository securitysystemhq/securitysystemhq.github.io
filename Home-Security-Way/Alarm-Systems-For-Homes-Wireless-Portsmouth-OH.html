<h3>CCTV Installation - How To Secure an IP Security Camera in Portsmouth</h3>
<p>We've reviewed all the major professional install and DIY security options to help you determine which is the best home security system for you. There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>
<p>It's a system that detects any unauthorized entry or motion into the property and sends out an immediate alert to the central monitoring station which further informs the concerned people, local police, hospital and fire station. You'll have the option to purchase a DIY home security package that includes smart home devices or add on devices of your choice. Your alarm system is composed of motion detectors, sensors for the doors and windows, a high decibel alarm, a control keypad and a battery backup in the event of a power failure.</p>

Technology has come such a long way that DIY systems can offer the same level of security (and often more) with a self installed system.
