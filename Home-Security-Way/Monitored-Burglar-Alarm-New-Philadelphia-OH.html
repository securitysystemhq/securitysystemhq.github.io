Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>The cameras deter crime and may lead some students to confess to infractions that weren't even caught on the security cameras. As mentioned, there is no need for a subscription plan, though there are contract-free Ring Protect Plans available, for either $3 or $10 a month, which allow you to store more video using the Ring app, as well as access member benefits and discounts on additional security product purchases.</p>
