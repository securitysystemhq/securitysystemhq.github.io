<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make. The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>

The most common alarm systems use the principle of circuits: closed and open. These are LED bulbs fitted on the camera, and switch on automatically in low light conditions and allow the camera to see in the dark in black and white images.</p>
<p>The video feed of the camera is then transmitted to a monitor or sets of monitors which you can easily view and record for surveillance purposes.
