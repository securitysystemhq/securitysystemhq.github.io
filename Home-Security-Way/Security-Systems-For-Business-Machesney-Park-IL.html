<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Wireless alarms look nicer but are more expensive. Footage is also often recorded at a lower resolution than wired cameras, making it more difficult to identify people in recordings. It also offered a pledge of commitment to security and released a fleet of updated equipment to settle customer worries and instill greater confidence in their services. A security camera DVR can operate remotely, it is able to detect movement and it has an internal memory that saves captured footage taken over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time.

<p>A wired camera has a video cable that transmits the video signal from the camera to a recording or viewing device. The detectors in a zone (or area) of the building are all connected to the same pair of wires. We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation.
