<p>Help secure your home with a smart security camera and motion sensors. In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras connected—either hardwired or wireless— to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. However, it is important to ensure the reliability and safe operation of fire-fighting equipment and installed systems such as fire alarms and emergency lighting.</p>
<p>The basic residential detection system, according to NFPA 74, relies primarily on the use of smoke detectors. It supports temperature, humidity and dust accumulation drift compensation and sensor fault inspection (fault reporting to fire alarm control panel).
