Sensors detect moving objects penetrating the protective grid and the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>Once the system detects intrusion, the house security system will send a sign either to the local police or to the monitoring company. That's where commercial-grade security camera systems can come in handy. Actually, the wireless CCTV camera type only sends data wirelessly and it still needs a cable for power supply, which set it apart from the truly wire-free CCTV camera types.
