<p>Many cities, businesses, and individuals have installed Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras for surveillance purposes. The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>
<p>A recent poll found that many physicians and patients are interested in employing remote monitoring technologies, although some respondents still expressed concerns about data security.

This means that all programming and "decisions" that an alarm panel has to make when it detects an intruder is all contained within the electronic circuit board that is installed in the home or business.</p>
<p>The next item in a home security monitoring system is evaluate is the receivers that contact police, fire, and emergency response. To use remote monitoring effectively, a risk assessment must be performed and included in the monitoring plan prior to the start of any clinical programme and adapted as the programme evolves.
