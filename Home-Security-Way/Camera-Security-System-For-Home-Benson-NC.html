<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>This camera gives a display resolution of 720p full HD video quality. The drop in prices attributed to great competition is factor to be considered in the growing popular use of burglar alarm systems.

<p>Advanced motion sensors include reliance on photo-sensory detection (say, a burglar walking into a beam of light from a light sensor source and breaks the path of the beam to trigger the alarm). With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters. Initiate optional ADT professional monitoring services, receive alerts, or set lights and other connected devices to turn on and off when extreme temperatures or smoke are detected in your home.</p>
