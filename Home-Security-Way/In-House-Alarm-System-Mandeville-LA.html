The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

<p>This solves the problem of difficult installation of traditional smoke alarms and enables people to view the status of the alarm remotely, so as to ensure the timeliness of the alarm. These are most commonly seen in offices and other businesses, but can work effectively as a home security surveillance system as well.

The rising awareness regarding the benefits of CCTV cameras in commercial sector is also increasing the demand for CCTV cameras. You can easily add additional sensors, and removing the system when you move house is a lot less tricky than for wired versions.</p>
