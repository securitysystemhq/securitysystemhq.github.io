It is true that a home security system can be a significant expense, especially when initially installing it. The equipment and the skill it takes to ensure it is properly installed will run you a few hundred dollars or more (unless you buy a DIY type from top security camera brands , which you can install by yourself).</p>
<p>These include sensors, smoke alarms, key fobs, panic buttons and hi-res cameras. Most security companies, whether they're DIY, professionally installed, professionally monitored, or self-monitored, will offer guidance if you're confused about what to choose.
