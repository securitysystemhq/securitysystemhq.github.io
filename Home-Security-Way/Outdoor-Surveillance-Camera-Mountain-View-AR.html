<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>
<p>You still get remote viewing capabilities on the Nest mobile app, but the system only stores clips (not continuous recording). The high cost associated with the installation and maintenance of home security systems is the key factor limiting the growth of this market. Gone are the days when only business owners relied on monitoring systems to protect their property. A wireless burglar alarm system can be easily expanded to include additional motion sensors and other peripherals (smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, driveway and pool sensors, motion activated lights, etc.). A hard-wired system may be limited to the number of peripherals offered by a particular service.</p>

<p>According to the Metropolitan Police, a massive 92% of all alarm activations in the UK in recent years have been false alarms. Heat detectors act like the previous two but will only send an alarm signal if it detects an extreme rise in temperature. T. Gowthami, G. Adiline Macriga, Smart Home Monitoring and Controlling System Using Android Phone, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Website: (ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 11, November 2013).</p>
<p>Some door alarms have an additional 'visitor' setting which gives a chime or bleep when the door is opened. You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>CCTV involves the use of an unmanned, remotely mounted video camera system, transmitting live pictures back to a television screen where developments can be monitored and recorded. Then hook up those cameras to a recording device. Indoor Cameras are the most common CCTV camera and are used in offices, homes, schools and retail establishments.
