CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes. Forecasting and Post-Event Investigations: The usefulness of surveillance technology in preventing and solving crimes depends on the resources put into it. The most effective systems are those which are monitored by trained staff, have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress, and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities.</p>

Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems.</p>
<p>4. A fire alarm inspection also includes checking whether fire extinguishers and other fire alarm devices are in the right places where people can get to them quickly in case of a fire.
