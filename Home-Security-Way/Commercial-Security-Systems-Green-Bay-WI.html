Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
