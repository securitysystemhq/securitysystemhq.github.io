Smart fire alarm systems can perform integrated automatic actions, for example, discharge fire-suppression systems in closed designated areas; and vary the notifications to support people on their way out, while protecting expensive electronic equipment inside. The test only used four smoke detectors and has not yet met the problem of excessive data volume.</p>
