<p>It seems like the question of how a fire alarm system works passes through everyone's mind at some point or another. All of the systems in this article are installed by professionals, which are good for those who don't have the time, patience, or expertise to install all the requisite sensors and equipment. Indoor alarm systems will allow monitoring within the house. In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void. Advantages provided by addressable alarm systems include stability, enhanced maintenance, and ease of modification.</p>

Most outdoor cameras are fairly easy to install but you might need to call in an electrician. If you are worried that your home can be robbed, it is a good idea to go for a combination intruder and fire monitoring service. This means that all programming and "decisions" that an alarm panel has to make when it detects an intruder is all contained within the electronic circuit board that is installed in the home or business.</p>
<p>The least expensive is the wired camera and it can be wired through a security DVR to your computer or to your router and the Internet.
