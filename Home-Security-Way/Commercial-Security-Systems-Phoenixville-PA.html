<p>CCTV camera security systems are the popular equipments used for security purposes now days. That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring of ICD patients is associated with reduced mortality irrespective of device type.

When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered.
