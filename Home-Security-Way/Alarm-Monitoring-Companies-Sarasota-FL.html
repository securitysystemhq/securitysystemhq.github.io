<p>ADT offers one of the largest sets of equipment options on the market. Furthermore, for remote monitoring validation the system is tested under Wi-Fi and 3G wireless protocols to find out about time delay, that is, the time taken to send data from patient's interface to doctor's interface, and found that the message sending time for both wireless protocols is under acceptable range of medical standards (4 to 6 minutes as per American Heart Association).</p>
