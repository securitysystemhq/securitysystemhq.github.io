<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>The cameras perform different functions depending on the type of surveillance system being used. They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it. With this problem in mind, most deaf people have security systems with sensors. Because of this arrangement, these systems are actually monitoring and controlling circuits, and not individual devices.</p>

Your system can act as a hub for up to 119 smart home devices, and can be controlled via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more.
