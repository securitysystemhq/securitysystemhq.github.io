Setting up a smart security system is relatively easy these days, with each gadget synching over Wi-Fi, but it's vital you take time to position sensors and cameras correctly to cover every vulnerable area.</p>

<p>The most basic burglar alarm systems monitor the perimeter of a home or building for breaches, such as opening a door or breaking a window. We all know that a fire alarm is used to detect smoke or heat - in the form of fire - and alert us to the danger so that we may vacate the presences in enough time to secure our safety. Scene 2: at the same time, in the living room, we lit a bunch of clothes to simulate a fire smoke, boil water in the kitchen to produce water mist, and in the bedroom and the bathroom we did nothing to maintain the normal air state, and we carried out the same number of simulations.</p>
<p>Home security systems that are 100% DIY let you pick the security products, set them up, and monitor them—all on your own. The camera transmits a signal to the receiving unit that can store the video signal in a proprietary DVR unit or in some cases directly onto a computer hard drive. Dusty buildup can lead to false alarms or delayed detection during an emergency. Installing a particular security monitoring system can certainly help cause you less of a burglar's target.</p>
