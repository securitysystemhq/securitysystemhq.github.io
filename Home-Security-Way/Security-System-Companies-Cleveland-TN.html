Sprinkler systems look bad and will harm the building's appearance. Not all surveillance cameras are static.

While the company's collaboration with Samsung SmartThings was somewhat of a disappointment, the company's new ADT Command platform has loftier ambitions.</p>
<p>We also found it easy to set up, scalable to small and large homes, and configurable with a variety of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors. In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars.
