<p>CCTV stands for closed circuit TV and CCTV cameras have become significant factor in preventing crime. 7. In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting a beam across said opening, an optical system arranged to divide the light from said source into two beams, means for receiving said light beams and converting said beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, a light chopper arranged so that the output of said receiving means is constant and to vary the voltage of said energy when one of said beams is intercepted by an intruder and means responsive to the varying volt- 85 age for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>
