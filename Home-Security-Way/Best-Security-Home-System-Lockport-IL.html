<p>One of the most important decisions you will have to make for your office is what type of fire alarm system you choose to have installed. I dont see how these CCTV cameras will stop terrorism. Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>

IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
<p>A fire alarm panel is generally pricier than its more traditional counterpart, which is the smoke alarm. Home security companies are giving customers plenty of choices for equipment and services. They include some home alarms, maybe some security cameras, and definitely some non lethal self defense weapons to protect you and your family from a home invader.
