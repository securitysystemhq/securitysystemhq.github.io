<p>According to the Metropolitan Police, a massive 92% of all alarm activations in the UK in recent years have been false alarms. Heat detectors act like the previous two but will only send an alarm signal if it detects an extreme rise in temperature. T. Gowthami, G. Adiline Macriga, Smart Home Monitoring and Controlling System Using Android Phone, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Website: (ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 11, November 2013).</p>
