<p>In the majority of successful systems, sensors need to be distributed to all areas of the building in order to detect fires in even the most remote corners. The sound activated burglar alarm circuit was constructed in accordance with the circuit designed as illustrated Figure 4. The design was simulated on electronics work bench 11.
