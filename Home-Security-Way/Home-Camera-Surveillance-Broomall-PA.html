<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically.

The following regulatory documents apply to the fire alarm system as opposed to individual smoke alarms of the residential type, even when they are AC powered and used for group operation.

Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
