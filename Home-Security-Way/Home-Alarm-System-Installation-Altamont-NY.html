<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>This camera gives a display resolution of 720p full HD video quality. The drop in prices attributed to great competition is factor to be considered in the growing popular use of burglar alarm systems.

<h3>Choosing the Best Security System For Your Home in Altamont</h3>
<p>The two devices strengthen an already compelling smart home security platform. Have your alarm system serviced regularly (at least once a year) and change the batteries in your sensors as soon as they start to get low, as this can be a common cause of alarm systems malfunctioning. No, we have security systems that use wireless, cellular technology. Digital CCTV cameras are generally equipped with an Internet Protocol (IP) Address.</p>
<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems. Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away.

<p>Dome CCTV cameras. As you will be installing a very large system of CCTV cameras, there will be some inconvenience with respect to the length of the cable. For larger businesses, however, we'd recommend a camera that can integrate more readily with existing systems like HomeKit, or SmartThings, or at least other Logitech cameras, as the Circle works best on its own. This home security camera stands out with customized notifications, video analytics, and seamless integration with the Vivint Sky smart home platform.</p>
