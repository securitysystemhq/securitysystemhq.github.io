Instead, it wirelessly transmits the video signal to a wireless receiver that is connected to your recording or viewing device. A few more advanced home security camera systems like our Alnet PC-Based DVR Systems and H.264 standalone DVR systems provide advanced remote viewing features that will even allow you to remotely record video to a PC over the internet.

Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
