<p>Indoor cameras are designed to sit inside and monitor an area. Several security systems offer integrations with popular voice activation hubs like Amazon Alexa, but experts predict companies that are moving toward voice controls will become obsolete. That means you can add, for example, a smart speaker to arm, disarm, and check system status with the sound of your voice, as well as trigger cameras or lights to go on based on alerts or your location.</p>
<p>In short, the proliferation of surveillance cameras has rapidly reduced our ability to maintain anonymity in public spaces; and the advent of automated face recognition and other tracking technologies only accelerate this threat to privacy. If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
