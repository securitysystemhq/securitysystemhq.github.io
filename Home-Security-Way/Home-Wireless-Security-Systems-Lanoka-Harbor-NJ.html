<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>This kit is a superb value way to invest in a home security system and experiment with smart home.

Choose from a wide range of Works with SmartThings devices, including lights, cameras, doorbells, door locks, thermostats, sensors, and more.</p>

<p>Dome CCTV cameras. As you will be installing a very large system of CCTV cameras, there will be some inconvenience with respect to the length of the cable.
