With the rate of how quickly technology improves in today's age, analog cameras are still very capable of delivering the convenience, safety, and security that consumers have come to expect at a lower cost than IP.

<p>The next item in a home security monitoring system is evaluate is the receivers that contact police, fire, and emergency response.

<p>Efficiency of burglar alarms depends on the zone triggered, number of zones, time of the day and other aspects installed within the monitoring system. The development of web-based intruder alarm systems from the evolution of the new APIs, and from the new languages based on the web 2.0 philosophy are now giving better ways and tools to design intruder alarm systems and to increase security - the road ahead to follow.</p>
