<p>When choosing a video surveillance system, you want to go with the best video quality for the buck, and with a Network IP camera, there are 10 reasons why you should consider them over 20th century CCTV cameras. However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan.

This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
