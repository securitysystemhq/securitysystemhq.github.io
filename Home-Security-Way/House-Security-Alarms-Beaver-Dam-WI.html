Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away. We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.</p>
<p>Additionally, devices that connect via Wi-Fi, such as security cameras and smart door locks, can be hacked to gain access to your home network. The operators observing the test could not believe it was night-time when viewing the camera. The company will find it difficult if not impossible to monitor the security systems when all of their equipment and employees are sitting in the dark.
