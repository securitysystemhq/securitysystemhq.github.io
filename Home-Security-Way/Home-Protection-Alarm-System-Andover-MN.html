<p>Hidden cameras and spy cameras are becoming increasingly popular for use in home security. Major players in the home security system market are ADT (US), Honeywell (US), Johnson Controls (US), HANGZHOU HIKVISION DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY (China), ASSA ABLOY (Sweden), SECOM (Japan), Robert Bosch (Germany), United Technologies (US), Godrej & Boyce (India), (US), Allegion (Republic of Ireland), Control4 (US), Schneider Electric (France), Legrand (France), ABB (Switzerland), Comcast (US), STANLEY Convergent Security Solutions (US), Nortek Security & Control (US), FRONTPOINT (US), and Vivint (US).</p>
<p>They provide a very low false alarm rate, and have a very high chance of detecting real burglars.

Alarms are also provided to alert building management when a sprinkler valve is closed. Mission effectiveness of a fire alarm safety system is based on four factors: Design, equipment, installation, and maintenance.</p>
<p>The least expensive is the wired camera and it can be wired through a security DVR to your computer or to your router and the Internet. A key aspect of fire protection is to identify a developing fire emergency in a timely manner, and to alert the building's occupants and fire emergency organizations. Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection.</p>
