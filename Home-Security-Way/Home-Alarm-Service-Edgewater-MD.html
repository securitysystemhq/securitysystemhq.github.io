<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>A recent poll found that many physicians and patients are interested in employing remote monitoring technologies, although some respondents still expressed concerns about data security. Most outdoor cameras are fairly easy to install but you might need to call in an electrician. If you are worried that your home can be robbed, it is a good idea to go for a combination intruder and fire monitoring service. This means that all programming and "decisions" that an alarm panel has to make when it detects an intruder is all contained within the electronic circuit board that is installed in the home or business.</p>
<p>Detection devices run the gamut, from smoke detectors and heat detectors to multi-capability detectors, which contain a number of functions in one detector. Most companies also offer yard signs and window decals to warn potential burglars that a house is protected by an alarm service.

All Speed Dome Series Thermal Cameras integrate thermal modules and optical modules together.</p>

<p>Web-based intruder alarm systems may include the use of distributed nets ("grids"), giving each node the ability to dynamically configure its functions within entire respect for the security scope issues. Some of these cameras even have digital video recorder capabilities to video the recordings at a later time. Passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors are used in the most advanced and also in some of the most simple security systems.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated many times that camera recording can be used to solve crimes. Video surveillance systems involve strategic placement of security cameras, monitoring motion and activity, generating alerts, transmitting footage, and storing that footage. The latest (2018) crime statistics suggest 31% of homes now have a burglar alarm of some sort, down slightly from last year (32%), but part of a general rising trend.</p>

<p>The siren and lights will alert the householder or neighbors that someone has broken into the house and the sound will often drive the intruder to run away quickly. Magnetic contacts will cause the alarm to sound if the circuit is broken: the neatest and most effective are flush-lilting (like mortice locks); surface-mounted contacts are easier to install and may be the only option on double doors or metal-framed windows.</p>
<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>

Based on David Davis' estimate, which is still unrivalled, the figure of how many CCTV cameras there are in London stands at around one camera for every 14 people, adding up to a total of about 422,000 - however this number is increasing.</p>
<p>Wireless security panels are generally very easy to program, making them great for DIY users. The control unit usually has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensors, and better systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, as well as internal trouble indicators (mains power loss, low battery, broken wire, etc.). Some manufacturers call a camera wireless” because it uses a Wi-Fi connection, and others refer to cameras that don't need to be plugged into an outlet.</p>
