The total cost of a home security system can be measured in three phases: purchase price, installation costs, and operating costs over time.</p>
<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>

Burglar alarm PIR (passive infrared) detectors are a common form of sensor which work by passively detecting radiated infrared - for all intents and purposes here, this is equivalent to body heat.
