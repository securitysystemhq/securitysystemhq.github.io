<p>Nowadays, all buildings are required to have some sort of fire prevention system in place to ensure the safety of the building's occupants in the event of a fire. Over the past few years there has been an upward trend in terms of migration to HD cctv camera surveillance. Thanks for sharing this great article About Cameras, my opinion is every person should Buy IP Camera because advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at. Installation will also depend on the company you purchase it through; special equipment may be needed to connect you directly to the security company or emergency personnel.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems.

Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
