<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>For the most trouble-free installation and the best in security, purchasing video surveillance systems from home security companies has distinctive benefits. In a fire alarm system there is always a smoke detector to detect smoke or fire.
