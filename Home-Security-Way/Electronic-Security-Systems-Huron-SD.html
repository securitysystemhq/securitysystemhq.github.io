<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>Drafts can disrupt the operation of smoke detectors and increase the occurrence of nuisance alarms.

However, in our next type of System, which is an Intelligent Fire Alarm system, each detector effectively incorporates its own computer which evaluates the environment around it and communicates to the Control Panel whether there is a fire, fault or the detector head needs cleaning.</p>
<p>Web-based intruder alarm systems may include the use of distributed nets ("grids"), giving each node the ability to dynamically configure its functions within entire respect for the security scope issues. Some of these cameras even have digital video recorder capabilities to video the recordings at a later time. Passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors are used in the most advanced and also in some of the most simple security systems.</p>
