<p>Did you know that a home security system is the best burglar deterrent you can have? ARD, absolute risk difference; CI, confidence interval; CV, cardiovascular; HR, hazard ratio for RM+IPE vs. IPE; IPE, in-person evaluation; IRR, incident rate ratio; NA, not available or not applicable; NYHA, New York Heart Association class; OR, odds ratio for RM+IPE vs. IPE; ppy, per patient-year; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RM, remote monitoring; RR, relative risk for RM+IPE vs. IPE; WHF, worsening heart failure.</p>
