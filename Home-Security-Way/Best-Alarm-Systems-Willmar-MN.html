<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe promoted the use of CCTV , saying that cameras should be installed by homeowners and businesses to help detectives solve crimes. If your CCTV security cameras at home are positioned in all possible entries a thief might use, the likelihood of recording their movements, their physical build, and even their faces are high but seizing them on the spot before they can cry uncle is not always successful.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time.
