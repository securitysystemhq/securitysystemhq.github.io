<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>Home security cameras are a crucial investment in protecting your home.
