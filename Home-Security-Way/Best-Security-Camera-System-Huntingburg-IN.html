<p>CCTV Cameras come in a variety of shapes and sizes. I am so glad that you have mentioned about smart home integration Just last week I was given bunch of cameras to install by a home owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. We've seen so many companies upgrade their equipment or add in new smart home features that we had to take a totally new look at the alarm systems out there. Once inside, the circuit system is not effective anymore since it is not practical to set up circuits in every inch of the house.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Wireless burglar alarms work similarly to wired ones, but the sensors communicate with the control panel via a radio frequency. Learn more about professional home security monitoring here.</p>

Selecting a company you can trust to provide quality monitoring is vital to ensuring the maximum return on this investment.</p>
<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>

<p>This allows the CCTV camera to increase the video image quality in low light conditions. Motion detection recording means only record when video camera detect movement, then it will start to record, no motion, then no record.
