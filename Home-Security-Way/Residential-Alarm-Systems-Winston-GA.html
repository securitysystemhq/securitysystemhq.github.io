In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting 65 light across said opening, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a photo-cell arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, said optical system comprising two mirrors 701 adapted to deflect said light beams onto said photo-cell, a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage and means responsive to the varying voltage to operate an alarm system.</p>
<p>For the most trouble-free installation and the best in security, purchasing video surveillance systems from home security companies has distinctive benefits. In a fire alarm system there is always a smoke detector to detect smoke or fire. Currently, no DIY home security systems work with HomeKit, but if you're a Google Home owner, you may prefer to choose one of our other picks. Each home security bundle features everything from burglary protection to back-up power in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control.
