<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>A recent poll found that many physicians and patients are interested in employing remote monitoring technologies, although some respondents still expressed concerns about data security. Most outdoor cameras are fairly easy to install but you might need to call in an electrician. If you are worried that your home can be robbed, it is a good idea to go for a combination intruder and fire monitoring service.

<p>We've reviewed all the major professional install and DIY security options to help you determine which is the best home security system for you. There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>
<p>These devices, installed e.g. in the security building, provide access to all functions of the system and its current status data. Managers and supervisors can use video surveillance to monitor employee productivity, determine job performance areas where the employee needs improvement and insure that employees follow company safety rules.
