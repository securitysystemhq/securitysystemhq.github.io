In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting 65 light across said opening, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a photo-cell arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, said optical system comprising two mirrors 701 adapted to deflect said light beams onto said photo-cell, a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage and means responsive to the varying voltage to operate an alarm system.</p>
