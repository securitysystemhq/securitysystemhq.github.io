When comparing video at the same angle of view (zoom length), higher resolution video provides facial detail farther away when using digital zoom for magnification. A passkey has also been assigned for secured data acquisition from sensors to the listening port of the smartphone.

Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations.
