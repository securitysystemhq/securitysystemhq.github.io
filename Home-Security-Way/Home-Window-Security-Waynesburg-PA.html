To protect your home from fire damage any time you will need a contract with a fire alarm monitoring service. Whether you decide to go with a DIY system or opt for a professionally installed system, you'll have to pay a monthly or annual fee if you require monitoring, and in some cases, you'll be hit with a monthly fee to pay off the cost of hardware components.</p>

If you are looking for a full proof security system to protect your house, you can use the combination of the motion detectors and open or closed circuit alarms. It's never an easy task to evacuate people from really large buildings, even with the latest in fire alarm design.
