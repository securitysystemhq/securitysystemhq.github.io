The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarmâ€”if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>

<p>Motion sensing cameras can send an alert to your security company or your smartphone app when they are triggered, allowing you to get a feed just at the moment you need it, rather than all the time.

If you haven't disarmed it in this given time frame, the monitoring center would receive your information in about 10 seconds or as specified by your home security company.</p>
<p>Analogue signals can also be converted into a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings In that case the analogue video camera must be plugged directly into a video capture card in the computer, and the card then converts the analogue signal to digital.
