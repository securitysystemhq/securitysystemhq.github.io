In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>You will want to know if the monitoring company has an additional plan in the event of a power outage at the monitoring station.

<p>Remote monitoring technologies have also become something of a focus for the tech device industry.

<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras.

These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>
