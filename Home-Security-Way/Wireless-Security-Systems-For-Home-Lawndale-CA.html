Note too that security systems aren't just about crime prevention: Most have add-on sensors that can protect your home from fire, flood, and even temperature changes (to prevent pipes from bursting, for one thing).</p>
<p>Fire protection systems are complex safety systems, which must be absolutely reliable in case of emergency. The fire alarm panel activates the flashers or the sounders, turns on sprinklers (or they can be activated along with the detector), or makes a call to the authorities or to the occupants. Intelligent addressable smoke detectors are compatible with MAXLOGIC series addressable panels.
