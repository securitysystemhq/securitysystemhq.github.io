<p>A fire alarm is a fire safety device that is utilised to alert the public about a fire outbreak. When comparing video at the same angle of view (zoom length), higher resolution video provides facial detail farther away when using digital zoom for magnification.

<h3>5 Reasons To Install A Video Security Camera System At Your Home in Sturgeon Bay</h3>
<p>It is quite common for modern day fire alarm control systems to make use of multiple control panels due to the complexity and needs of a commercial facility or business. In this case, you will probably want a security system that has a quality control panel with a panic button, loud siren, two-way talk feature, high-quality surveillance cameras with real-time recordings and cloud storage, a doorbell camera, and some home automation features that will enable you to monitor and control your system remotely.</p>
<p>Some door alarms have an additional 'visitor' setting which gives a chime or bleep when the door is opened. You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
