<p>You can't power your CCTV camera over your Ethernet network, and this is beneficial because you don't need a power outlet to power a network camera.

<p>Dome CCTV cameras. As you will be installing a very large system of CCTV cameras, there will be some inconvenience with respect to the length of the cable. For larger businesses, however, we'd recommend a camera that can integrate more readily with existing systems like HomeKit, or SmartThings, or at least other Logitech cameras, as the Circle works best on its own. This home security camera stands out with customized notifications, video analytics, and seamless integration with the Vivint Sky smart home platform.</p>

If you have caps on your internet data usage, make sure you understand how your security camera(s) could impact your monthly bill.
