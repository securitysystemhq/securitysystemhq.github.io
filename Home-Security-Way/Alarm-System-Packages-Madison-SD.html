Various sensors like Motion sensor, flame detector and touch sensor are interfaced to the system. When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house.

The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>

The motion detectors for indoors are suitable for stores, offices, public facilities and residential buildings, in addition to manufacturing, machine shops and garages, for example.

If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
