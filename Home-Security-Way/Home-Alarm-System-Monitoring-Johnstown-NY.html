Nowadays, house alarms or home security systems are preferably needed to ensure the house security from burglars and criminals.

<p>In addition, the marriage of mass-notification systems (MNS) and fire-alarm control systems is a growing trend that will hopefully continue and be applied in larger varieties of facilities and multibuilding properties, including schools, high-rise buildings, mass-transit hubs, and even public gathering places such as theaters, restaurants, and places of worship. They also have a regular inspection schedule for checking out public buildings and their fire safety equipment.</p>
