<p>The basic purpose of an automatic fire alarm system is to detect a fire in its early stages, notify the building occupants that there is a fire emergency and report the emergency to first responders. Provide a current copy of the installer's state license to the Miami-Dade Police Department's False Alarm Enforcement Unit (FAEU). When combined with face recognition , surveillance camera networks raise additional privacy and civil rights concerns—particularly because face recognition data is prone to error.</p>

It begins with the proliferation of cameras for police and security, and ends with a powerful new industry imperative: complete visual surveillance of public space.</p>
