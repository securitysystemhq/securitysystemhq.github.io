<p>CCTV Cameras come in a variety of shapes and sizes. I am so glad that you have mentioned about smart home integration Just last week I was given bunch of cameras to install by a home owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. We've seen so many companies upgrade their equipment or add in new smart home features that we had to take a totally new look at the alarm systems out there. Once inside, the circuit system is not effective anymore since it is not practical to set up circuits in every inch of the house.</p>

Kisi is designed to work with the two most used burglar alarm system styles: an integrated alarm system, and a pin code alarm system. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and how long you plan to keep recorded footage.</p>
