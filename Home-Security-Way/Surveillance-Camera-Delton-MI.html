<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>In addition, any attempt to force entry that is detected is forwarded to an alarm control panel, which then reliably sets off a loud alarm and the offender is forced to escape. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
<p>The ADT app makes controlling your home security simple and intuitive with our interface. Boasting 360-degree continuous pan range, and -5 to 90-degree or more tilt range, the speed dome series thermal cameras can automatically track targets in thermal and optical channels simultaneously when an alarm is triggered. There are new and advanced CCTV mega-pixel cameras available which can take 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution images of the camera scene either on a time lapse or motion detection basis.</p>

It is true that a home security system can be a significant expense, especially when initially installing it. The equipment and the skill it takes to ensure it is properly installed will run you a few hundred dollars or more (unless you buy a DIY type from top security camera brands , which you can install by yourself).</p>
<p>Smaller systems have sensors for the main entry point and interior camera. This eliminates the need for cables, allowing installation to be much simpler than wired security cameras. CCTV Camera Pros is a direct supplier of security cameras and video surveillance systems for home, business, and government. Many types of businesses must have a video surveillance system in place to comply with HIPPA or SEC regulations as well as internal corporate policies.</p>
