<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Vivint wireless security camera systems can be outfitted with motion sensor technology that is both energy-efficient and more secure. Presently, sophisticated burglar alarm ranging from miniature, self-contained noisemakers, to intricate, multi-zoned systems having color-coded computer monitor outputs are available. They receive a signal from a fire sensor (smoke, heat or carbon monoxide detector) and automatically transmit it to the fire alarm panel.</p>

<p>Wired cameras are the standard for this technology. Make sure your fire detection, protection and extinguishing systems function properly before or when fire breaks out. The basic set-up includes a standard security keypad, 2 door or window sensors, 1 motion detector, 1 interior siren, 1 master control panel, security yard signs and labels.
