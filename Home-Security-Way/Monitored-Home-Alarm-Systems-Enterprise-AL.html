Smoke and fire detectors that aren't wired directly into your alarm system cannot summon emergency personnel.</p>

When one of these initiating devices is triggered, the control panel will go into an alarm state. Wireless‚Äù usually refers to the use of wireless technology like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for monitoring and to connect the components of your system.
