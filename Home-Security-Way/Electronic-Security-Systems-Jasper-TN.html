For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house.

The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>

Smart device integration: If you have a home full of smart devices, consider looking for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that includes a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or—eventually a Thread—radio that can connect them.
