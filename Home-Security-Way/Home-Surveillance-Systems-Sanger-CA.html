<p>Panasonic, leading the global security industry for 60 years, will continue to provide world-top-class innovative intelligent AI security solutions supported by Panasonic unique video capturing x sensing‚Äù technology for a safer tomorrow. Stability for the Ultra Series NVRs is ensured by using RAID and N+1 hot spare, ensuring smooth and reliable video streaming and recording. All installed components, including sensors, are linked to a control panel. A few years ago, you'd need to budget thousands in order to create a video monitoring, web-connected, home security system, but today you can install a few affordable wireless sensors, a connected motion-sensing camera and enjoy 24-7 home monitoring, with alerts sent direct to your phone from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>They provide a very low false alarm rate, and have a very high chance of detecting real burglars. Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is usually a simple process, and it is often possible to bring all of your existing devices and sensors to the new wireless system.

A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing. The usual forms of such photoelectric burglar alarm systems operate on the absolute principle, i. e., the amount of light reaching the cell surface determines the voltage on the control grid of the associated vacuum tube.</p>
