However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan. Dome cameras are typically used for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The central module connects at the Internet via WiFi and through an application we can remotely monitor the state of the house or control various devices within the enclosure. Abode's small scale makes it easy to forgo professional monitoring, especially if your main goal is to stay connected to what's happening at home instead of deterring intruders.</p>
<p>Stream your home cameras through your phone, arm your alarm system, and control all of your home devices from the same app. Abode also offers a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensor and one motion detector.
