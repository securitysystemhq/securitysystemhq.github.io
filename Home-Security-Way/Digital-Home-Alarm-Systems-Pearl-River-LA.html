We all know that a fire alarm is used to detect smoke or heat - in the form of fire - and alert us to the danger so that we may vacate the presences in enough time to secure our safety. Scene 2: at the same time, in the living room, we lit a bunch of clothes to simulate a fire smoke, boil water in the kitchen to produce water mist, and in the bedroom and the bathroom we did nothing to maintain the normal air state, and we carried out the same number of simulations.</p>
