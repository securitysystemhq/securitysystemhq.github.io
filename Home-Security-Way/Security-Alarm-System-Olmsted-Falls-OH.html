There is a delay of several seconds which allows the homeowner time to enter the property and key in the security code to turn the system off. To extend the backup time only plug the DVR and camera power supply to the backup unit and the monitor to regular power strip, this way if we do loose power for some time the DVR and cameras are still functioning as normal while monitor is off.</p>
