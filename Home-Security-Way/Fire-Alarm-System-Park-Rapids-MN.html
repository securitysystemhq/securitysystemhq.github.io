You may have noticed that the use of security systems, surveillance cameras, security guards and even 'under-cover' security personnel has increased dramatically in malls and even small mom-and-pop and convenience stores.</p>
<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
