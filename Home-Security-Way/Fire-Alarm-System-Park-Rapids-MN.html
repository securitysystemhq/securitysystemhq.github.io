You may have noticed that the use of security systems, surveillance cameras, security guards and even 'under-cover' security personnel has increased dramatically in malls and even small mom-and-pop and convenience stores.</p>
<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>These can be fitted with timers so that they come on only during the night, and using low-energy bulbs makes them very inexpensive to leave on. You will have full colour images all night and even if you need to buy several lights it will likely be far less expensive than a camera with infra-red capability. All they need is access to the IP camera's network via the Internet. If your alarm is set and your home security is breached your alarm system will automatically and immediately send a distress signal to the monitoring company.</p>
