Honeywell's new Home system actually integrates a complete Alexa speaker and wide-angle 1080p camera into the base station, but it lacks any sort of professional monitoring service. With its appealing design, microSD storage slot and the surprise bonus of an audio out jack, this little camera is a cut above the most basic IP cameras.</p>
<p>Most have motion detection settings that only record footage when the camera detects movement. However, with the proper placement of the wireless sensors in your home, your wireless home security alarm system will be just as secure - if not more - than a hardwired system.

This could come in different types and one good example is a CCTV security system which is obtained though placing of video cameras in strategic locations in and around your home.</p>

As a rule, any of the local security companies with brands that you are not aware of, typically have ADT, Brinks or Monotronics behind them doing the actual monitoring.</p>
