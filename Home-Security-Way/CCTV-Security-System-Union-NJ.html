<p>Most office buildings, school, hospitals and homes today have fire alarm systems installed. Once you've installed your system, simply connect the DVR to your internet router or modem and you can view your cameras anywhere in the world at no additional charge. A bespoke intruder alarm system, supplied and maintained by ClearView, will deter and detect potential intruders to your site.
