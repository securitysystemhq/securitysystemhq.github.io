<p>Most office buildings, school, hospitals and homes today have fire alarm systems installed. Once you've installed your system, simply connect the DVR to your internet router or modem and you can view your cameras anywhere in the world at no additional charge.

<p>The Base Station also has a USB port for storing recordings on an external hard drive, a nice supplement to the free cloud storage, and it's more secure than systems that record to a microSD card in the camera itself: Because the storage is tucked away safely indoors, if someone steals your camera, they won't get your video, too.
