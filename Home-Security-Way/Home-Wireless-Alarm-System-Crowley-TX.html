Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors).
