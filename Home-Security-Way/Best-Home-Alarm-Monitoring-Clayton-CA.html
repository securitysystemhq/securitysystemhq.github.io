<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>If communication with one home monitoring center is interrupted, the other centers takes over quickly, giving them the ability to offer continuous security through the company's advanced alarm monitoring service - providing clients with increased safety and peace of mind. Subsequently, thermal detectors are usually not permitted in life safety applications.
