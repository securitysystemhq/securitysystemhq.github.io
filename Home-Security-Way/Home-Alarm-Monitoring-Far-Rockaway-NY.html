What this means is that the camera can be powered and transfer video feed all with one Cat5 cable, rather than running a power cable and a separate video cable the way that analog cameras do.

<p>Some door alarms have an additional 'visitor' setting which gives a chime or bleep when the door is opened. You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
