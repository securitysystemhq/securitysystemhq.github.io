Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
<p>FACPs, or fire alarm control units, comprise of electric panels that function as the controlling components of a fire alarm system (Fig. So, additional DVRs may be needed to support sites requiring many cameras. The SSP Fire Detection and Alarm System (FDAS) meets the strict EN54 safety standards. They are more flexible as compared to earlier analog VHS tape systems and allow easier transmission of video over a computer network.</p>
<p>Before addressable heads, fire alarm panels would merely display the general location of the fire by identifying a generic zone.

<p>CCTV (Closed Circuit TV) uses one or more video cameras to transmit video and sometimes audio images to a monitor, set of monitors, or video recorder. Many professionally monitored home security systems require a contract, and contract length can range from three to five years. You can install one of these alarms yourself, or you can pay a one-off fee to have it installed by a professional.

<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.

<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded.
