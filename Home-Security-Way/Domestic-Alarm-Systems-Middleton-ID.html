Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
<p>FACPs, or fire alarm control units, comprise of electric panels that function as the controlling components of a fire alarm system (Fig. So, additional DVRs may be needed to support sites requiring many cameras. The SSP Fire Detection and Alarm System (FDAS) meets the strict EN54 safety standards.
