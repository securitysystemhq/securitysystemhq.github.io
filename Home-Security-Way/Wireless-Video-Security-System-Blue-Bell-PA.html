A substantial amount of time can be saved during investigation and prosecution by using evidence from security camera footage.</p>

For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. LifeShield's smart DIY security systems range in price from around $300 to $500, and you can get professional monitoring without a contract. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area.</p>
