<p>CCTV cameras also known as close circuit television have been a part of our lives since the year 1942 when they were first used by Siemens AG to observe the take-off of V2 rockets in Nazi Germany. They are small, portable, and can often be programmed so you can view surveillance footage via the internet, which means you can even check on your home while you're on vacation. It's also used by the control panel to monitor the state (alarm or no alarm) of the initiating devices and zone wiring.

Some burglar alarms come with infra-red sensors, which activates an alarm when the sensor is crossed. Approximately 1 out of every 6 American families has an alarm system, and according to the National Burglar & Fire Alarm Association, the number of security-protected residences is rising.</p>
<p>Brinks Home Security, one of the established names in the industry, recently received a facelift after MONI Smart Security purchased the name rights to the company and gave the company a serious overhaul.

<p>Fortunately, in many circumstances wherein a CCTV surveillance system is in place, wrongdoers commonly shy away from these monitored places because they fear prosecution and any recorded images involving their presence can be used in court. This IP surveillance camera system uses multiple fixed contextual view cameras with one moving PTZ camera, to simplify permanent and temporary deployment options, for CCTV security, people surveillance and traffic management.</p>
