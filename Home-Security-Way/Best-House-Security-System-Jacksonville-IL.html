<p>All buildings need to have fire safety equipment in order to ensure the safety of the people who occupy the building. Instead, it wirelessly transmits the video signal to a wireless receiver that is connected to your recording or viewing device. A few more advanced home security camera systems like our Alnet PC-Based DVR Systems and H.264 standalone DVR systems provide advanced remote viewing features that will even allow you to remotely record video to a PC over the internet.

<p>We provide burglar alarms which utilize the most recent innovation to secure your belonging and can be customized to suit your particular needs. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets or security personnel on patrolling and physical surveillance. They come in wide variety of configurations, but generally how alarms work is with a network of motion detectors and door and window sensors integrated with a control panel.</p>
<p>In the case of pan-and-tilt cameras, the camera lens will automatically point itself in the direction of the motion and record. Before secondary and middle school officials install video surveillance systems to prevent vandalism, gang activity, fights, trespassing or theft, they must sit down and conduct a thorough inventory of their needs and security concerns. The STROBE signal is the output from the alarm control panel that will enable the flash lamps from the external sounder.</p>

And here comes the kicker - 65% of seniors are open to or would like to use new technology and 54% said they would consider sensors to monitor their health and safety.</p>
