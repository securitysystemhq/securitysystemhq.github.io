<p>Prior to fire alarms, smoke detectors were primarily the main indicator for alerting the occupants of a building to a fire. Without a plan, you'll still get a quality camera with a great viewing angle. It is best if you use a local company because they are often more in-tune with what is happening in your specific area and some even offer discount fees to local residents taking up their monitoring service. DVRs come in 4, 8, 9, and 16 channel increments and this selection is critical because adding cameras above the DVR channels available will require an additional DVR, not just additional channels.</p>
<p>Depending on the anticipated fire scenario, building and use type, number and type of occupants, and criticality of contents and mission, these systems can provide several main functions. Arm and disarm your home security system, view live video feeds, lock or unlock your doors, and even adjust your smart thermostat directly from your phone. ADT (US), Moni (US), Honeywell (US), Securitas (Sweden), UTC (US), Schneider (France), Johnson Controls (US), Vivint (US), Vector Security (US), and Bosch (Germany) are some of the major companies dominating the alarm monitoring market.</p>
<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely. They are great for those in rented accommodation as they can be removed just as easily as they were installed so when you move on to your new home, you can take the alarm system with you. Fire alarms reduce property loss: While strobe lights and sirens don't actively put out fires, they alert the people who can.</p>

<p>In wireless systems, the signal from the detectors to the control panel is transmitted with radio frequency.

Note too that security systems aren't just about crime prevention: Most have add-on sensors that can protect your home from fire, flood, and even temperature changes (to prevent pipes from bursting, for one thing).</p>
<p>All sprinkler systems require a reliable water source. The main components in the system are key pad, control panel, zones, and input and output devices. 2. Loss Prevention - CCTV cameras can help keep personal belongings, merchandise and money where it belongs. There are essentially two types of security lighting you can fit to your house.
