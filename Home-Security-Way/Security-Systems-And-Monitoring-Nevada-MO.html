<p>Experts believe that CCTV discourages opportunistic crime, where an offender spontaneously takes advantage of a situation. Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
<p>Like any product that connects to the internet and uses wireless technology, smart home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, particularly systems that lack encryption. This helps eliminate false alarms and unnecessary responses. When something moves in the room and blocks the light signal, the sensor picks this up and alerts the control panel. We present a broad assortment of CCTV Cameras including Motion Activated Solar Light DVR that records both video as well as audio whenever activated by even a slightest motion.</p>

Most of our surveillance systems include DVR viewer software for Mac and Windows PCs, as well as camera viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android mobile devices.</p>
<p>With the advent of modern technology you now have smarter and affordable home security systems that you can set up all by yourself.

<p>A wire-less system has components similar to a conventional wired-in do-it-yourself burglar alarm system, but the communication between the various parts is by radio waves rather than by electricity.

Surveillance camera come in all shapes and sizes and trying to figure out which surveillance system that will fit your needs can be very frustrating, but most cameras and systems today requires very little experience to install and operate.

<p>For example, a department store could use video surveillance cameras to track foot traffic so that they can position their merchandise in key zones. All you will need is a battery to power the circuit, a switch to install on the door frame, a magnet in the door and a buzzer or alarm to connect to the circuit.
