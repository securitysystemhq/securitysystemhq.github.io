<p>So you're interested in purchasing a CCTV camera for either home security or for commercial use, but you don't know what type of camera to purchase? For microcontroller MC2 , keypad is connected to port 1 and LCD display is connected to port 2 and motor driver is connected to pins P1.2 and P1.3 and touch sensor is connected to pin P1.4. Motion detector is connected to pin P3.3 and taken as a input interrupt (INT1) to the microcontroller 2. The password request switch is connected to pin P3.2 and taken as a input interrupt (INT0) to the microcontroller.</p>
<p>They provide a very low false alarm rate, and have a very high chance of detecting real burglars.

<h3>Trying to Outsmart a Home Security System in Campbell</h3>
<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard drive.

The best cameras now offer computer-like functions and features, like motion sensors and automatic mobile notifications.</p>

Responding to false alarms can consume thousands of personnel hours at a cost to taxpayers and place the safety of citizens truly in need of law enforcement response in jeopardy.</p>
