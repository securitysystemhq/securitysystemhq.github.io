<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring and control (M&C) systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as factories, power plants, network operations centers, airports, and spacecraft, with some degree of automation. That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. Professionally installed systems take the trouble out of things for homeowners who don't have the time or expertise to set up all the sensors and accessories themselves.</p>

After the control panel receives a signal for an initiating device and goes into an alarm state, the panel initiates output devices that signal to building occupants that there is an emergency situation.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras have, and will provide a solution to many crimes. This can be accomplished wirelessly and you can even use you mobile phone as the monitoring device to let you view what is happening in your home at any given time.

Sometimes they are referred to as lipstick cameras. With over 400 cameras installed across the City, video surveillance has become another critical and valuable resource for public safety.

<p>This preserves video integrity in case a motion event is missed, and is very helpful when reviewing recorded security footage to allow the user to skip to points in the timeline when motion is detected. Prevention is always better, so dummy alarm boxes and outdoor security cameras and lights are also great options.
