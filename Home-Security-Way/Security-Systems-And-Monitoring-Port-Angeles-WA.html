<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>

<p>The surveillance cameras did nothing to help the man. SD Card - many IP cameras come with SD card storage and the main video footage stored is when there are motions detected. An annunciator panel is sometimes employed to monitor the status of the different areas in a designated fire zone for theft protection and control of a facility's alarm devices. Usually the microphonic detection systems are installed as sensor cables attached to rigid chainwire fences, however some specialised versions of these systems can also be installed as buried systems underground.</p>

Here we outline the most common reasons for false alarms and how you can prevent them from happening.
