<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Every system comes with a free app that allows you to view your cameras anywhere in the world as long as you have internet. Position your cameras strategically around the premises you want to monitor.

One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally. A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing.
