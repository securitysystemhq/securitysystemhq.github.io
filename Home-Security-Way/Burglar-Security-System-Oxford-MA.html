<h2>Home Security System Review Oxford Massachusetts</h2>
<p>CCTV (Closed Circuit TV) uses one or more video cameras to transmit video and sometimes audio images to a monitor, set of monitors, or video recorder. Many professionally monitored home security systems require a contract, and contract length can range from three to five years. You can install one of these alarms yourself, or you can pay a one-off fee to have it installed by a professional. Networks of cameras are installed by government agencies and by local businesses, but the distinction blurs with the development of real-time crime centers that access both public and private video feeds.</p>

<p>And that includes security cameras: 1080p HD resolution, pan and zoom functions, and wide-angle lenses that give you a more complete picture. When it comes to home security systems, one of the benefits is the ability to watch the footage again later in the case of a break in. Professional monitoring includes this storage in their monthly fee, but for home monitoring-based systems, you will need some type of storage.</p>
