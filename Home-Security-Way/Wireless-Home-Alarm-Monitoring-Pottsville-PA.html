<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>Today's home security systems are effective and affordable. Installing number of cameras allows the security staff to watch both the customers and employees to prevent theft of shop supplies.
