The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>
<p>Swansea University has installed a network of Advanced fire alarm control panels to protect its 65-acre, £450million Bay campus from the threat of fire.
