<h4>Surveillance Camera System Hayden 83835</h4>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted. Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>
<p>This is a simple device which will sense intrusion using wireless sensors like door magnetic sensors. The CITRUS study was very thorough and is frequently cited as evidence that surveillance cameras don't work, even though the study found significant positive effects from the cameras. As part of your burglar alarm, a monitored fire alarm system can actually alert the authorities if smoke is detected in your home.</p>
