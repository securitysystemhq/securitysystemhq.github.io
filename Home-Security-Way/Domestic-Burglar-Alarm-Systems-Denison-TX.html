<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>When it comes to a closed-circuit, no energy means alarms sound immediately. This uses the latest innovations in video compression technology to provide high resolution video quality from the smallest amount of video data required. Fire alarm systems typically consist of several inter-linked components, such as smoke detectors, heat detector, carbon monoxide, manual call points, sounders, alarm and buzzer. Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>Most home security cameras perform the same basic functions—they detect an event, record the event, and send you an alert—but they don't all perform them the same way. Two Remote Monitoring Centers ensure full coverage where professionals process information received from your devices and trigger the appropriate response, which includes logging the event, emailing and calling contacts, and escalating issues as needed and according to service agreements.</p>
