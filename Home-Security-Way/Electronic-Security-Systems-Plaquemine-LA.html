Wireless cameras don't require the installation of lengthy cords to a recording device.</p>

Most businesses do not routinely test their fire alarms and of those that do, many do not properly test the systems.</p>
<p>4. A fire alarm inspection also includes checking whether fire extinguishers and other fire alarm devices are in the right places where people can get to them quickly in case of a fire.
