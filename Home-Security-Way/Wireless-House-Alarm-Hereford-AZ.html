A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>For example, if you have mobility issues, you will probably want as many home automation features as you can get your hands on. These will allow you to remotely access, monitor, and control your entire home security system and much of your home's equipment such as door locks, window blinds, small appliances, thermostat, garage door, and more. Having such features will enable you more flexibility with remote or voice controls and without having to physically handle these systems manually.</p>

<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. In these systems, the monitor to be viewed will often be automatically shifted to a larger screen and will activate recording equipment.</p>
