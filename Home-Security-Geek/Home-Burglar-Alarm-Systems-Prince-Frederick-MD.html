<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>You may have to pay more for packages that come with smart home devices and capabilities. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered.

<p>Section from our smart video doorbell guide. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company.

<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is one of the most common sensors found in household and small business environments. An important component of the video system is the analog or digital video signal transmission means from the camera to the remote site and to the monitoring and recording site.
