Nowadays, house alarms or home security systems are preferably needed to ensure the house security from burglars and criminals. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service — which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups — is also expensive if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
