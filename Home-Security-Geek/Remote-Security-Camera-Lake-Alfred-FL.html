From wireless to hybrid control panels, there is just the right type of alarm system waiting for you. With a wired system, all your sensors are physically connected to the alarm panel via wiring.

<p>Both seniors and caregivers agree (more than 80% of each group) that home safety devices, including monitors, would be an enabler of feeling safer and having more peace of mind.

<p>Ring (owned by Amazon since 2018) is first and foremost a smart home technology company. However, the 24-hour service offered by monitoring may make you feel more secure, and the company will be liable if no action is taken in the event of a burglary. The monitoring plan should retain flexibility to increase on-site monitoring in case of issues or problems - for example, sites with a high number of protocol violations or poor data quality may require additional visits to teach and mentor study staff, or conversely sites with low adverse event rates contradictory to predictions or other site metrics.</p>
