The fact is that the proper equipment can save lives. In reality it does not work that well, as extreme weather may often cause false alarms. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm. Although the controlling is done automatically when the sensors detect the change in the environment, you can also control the project using the android app or through the webaddress.</p>
