<p>NFPA 72 provides the latest safety provisions to meet society's changing fire detection, signaling, and emergency communications demands. A:Surveillance cameras can help deter crimes. DVRs can save CCTV data for up to 10 weeks of recording time and there are even some which has motion detection technology.

<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house.

The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system.
