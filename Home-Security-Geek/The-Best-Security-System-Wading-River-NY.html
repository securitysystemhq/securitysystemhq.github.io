<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>But when the door or window is opened by an intruder, the circuit will be open, thus the alarm will be triggered. A video surveillance camera can be used for other types of tests on cars.

Two-stage fire alarm systems warn only certain people who are authorized to take appropriate action before the second stage.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning. Also if you are connecting to a monitor or a DVR; it may be a wise idea to switch which port you are connecting to, this way you can determine if your video port has gone bad. When activated, the company notifies authorities, whether that's the police for burglary or the fire department for a fire.</p>
