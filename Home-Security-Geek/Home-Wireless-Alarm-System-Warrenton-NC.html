<p>Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council, says: Fire-alarm systems and smoke alarms are life-safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters.

Designed for unique purposes and scenarios, Hikvision's Special Series is integral to reliable network video solutions that require more than standard network cameras can offer. If you choose not to add another monthly fee to the mix, you may be disappointed with what the Nest Cam Outdoor can (and can't) do.
