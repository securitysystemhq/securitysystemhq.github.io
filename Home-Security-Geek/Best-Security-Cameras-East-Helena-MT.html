<p>In addition, the marriage of mass-notification systems (MNS) and fire-alarm control systems is a growing trend that will hopefully continue and be applied in larger varieties of facilities and multibuilding properties, including schools, high-rise buildings, mass-transit hubs, and even public gathering places such as theaters, restaurants, and places of worship. They also have a regular inspection schedule for checking out public buildings and their fire safety equipment.</p>
<p>While DVR is needed for analog cameras and NVR is used with IP cameras, some recorders are only compatible with specific camera brands. For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>
