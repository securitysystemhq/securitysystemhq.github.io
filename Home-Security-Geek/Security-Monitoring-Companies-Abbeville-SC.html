<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Drafts can disrupt the operation of smoke detectors and increase the occurrence of nuisance alarms. When a provider allows customers to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring.” Customers can monitor their homes with the help of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras. Remote monitoring enables doctors to consult and review real-time patient data, reducing emergency admissions and the number of home visits and appointments needed.</p>

A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing.
