<p>Initially, fire alarm systems are designed to detect any element associated with fires. Modern line detectors are very stable and false alarms caused by animal motion, rain, fog or snow have been eliminated.

The first signal sent by your control panel will alert monitoring personnel at the central station, who will call to notify you and confirm whether it's a real emergency or a false trigger.</p>
<p>Wireless alarms look nicer but are more expensive. Footage is also often recorded at a lower resolution than wired cameras, making it more difficult to identify people in recordings.

<p>Surveillance cameras will catch the thief before, or during the process of committing the crime. Based on all fire code criteria and the building worksheet it is determined that additional information is necessary to conclude with certainty that removal of any portion or all of the fire alarm system will not adversely affect either the compliance of the building or the function of other life safety systems in the building.</p>
<p>These are some of the most important features to keep in mind when comparing home security cameras. You might want to consider a traditional burglar alarm system; this will give you sensors on your doors and windows, and alert you to any intruders. Look for surveillance cameras that have at least 100 feet or better of night vision. However, many CCTV providers recommend that this dilemma can be solved by putting some CCTV equipments in places where constant observance and security matters most.</p>
<p>The video feed of the camera is then transmitted to a monitor or sets of monitors which you can easily view and record for surveillance purposes. For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. LifeShield's smart DIY security systems range in price from around $300 to $500, and you can get professional monitoring without a contract. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area.</p>
