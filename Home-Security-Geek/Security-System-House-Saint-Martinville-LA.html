<p>Today there's a lot more to a home security camera than video surveillance. In a remote monitoring approach, combined with Risk Based Monitoring , you are moving away from 100% SDV onsite. I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Wireless burglar alarms work similarly to wired ones, but the sensors communicate with the control panel via a radio frequency. Learn more about professional home security monitoring here.</p>

<p>All companies and businesses should regularly carry out routine tests on their fire alarms but, in the UK, The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 also requires that fire alarm systems are properly tested and maintained, and the best way to do this is to use the services of an electrical contractor. Along with security cameras and devices to view and record camera images, Other pieces of surveillance equipment may be necessary to complete a video security system.</p>

<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems. Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away. We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.</p>
<p>The technical specifics may be slightly different for each security provider, but the basics of alarm monitoring is similar in any home security system. HSI offer a range of Fibreglass poles for testing detectors at height designed to be used with the Enclosed Delivery System or Heat Testing equipment.
