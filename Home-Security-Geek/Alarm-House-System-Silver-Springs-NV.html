With the rate of how quickly technology improves in today's age, analog cameras are still very capable of delivering the convenience, safety, and security that consumers have come to expect at a lower cost than IP.

<p>In addition, any attempt to force entry that is detected is forwarded to an alarm control panel, which then reliably sets off a loud alarm and the offender is forced to escape. With city spaces blanketed in cameras, and video analytics to make sense of them, law enforcement agencies gain the capacity to record and analyze everything, all the time. Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
