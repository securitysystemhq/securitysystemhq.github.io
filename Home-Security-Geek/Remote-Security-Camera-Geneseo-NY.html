<p>A fire alarm annunciator is a device that is incorporated into the fire alarm system.

<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>On the minus side is the inconvenience of activating and deactivating the alarm, and the cost and problems with false alarms.
