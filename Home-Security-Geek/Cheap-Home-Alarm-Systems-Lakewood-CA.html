<p>Having a home security system isn't just about protecting your home and family, it's about your peace of mind as well. A 7-inch wireless touchscreen panel sits at the heart of the platform, supporting 250 third-party smart home devices like thermostats, lights, and doors as well as ADT's own home security hardware There's support for remote device control from ADT's new mobile app, home automation scenes and geofenced actions, triggering lights and unlocking your front door, for example, as you approach your home.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
