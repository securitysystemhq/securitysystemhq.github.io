<p>Others can also be programmed to bypass or ignore individual sensors (once or multiple times) and leave the remainder of the system armed. IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>

They also don't need to worry about creating a detailed sketch of the facility, showing exact camera type, placement, and field of view for an installer, and then ensuring that the cameras spec'd are placed in the locations intended, - heck, the salesman might even have to visit the site during installation if he specs different types of cameras in different places.</p>
