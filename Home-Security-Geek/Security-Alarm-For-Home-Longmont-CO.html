<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>

<p>You will want to know if the monitoring company has an additional plan in the event of a power outage at the monitoring station. B) Open-circuit systems - In an open circuit what happens is when somebody opens the door the open-circuit is completed and electricity starts flowing so the alarm is prompted. You can find a lot of monitoring devices. The Radar is used to measure the speed of vehicles and provides speed results to cameras.</p>

Brinks equipment options include basic home security or home security with video, and the alarm panel is also a smart home hub compatible with Z-wave and Alexa devices.</p>
<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>
