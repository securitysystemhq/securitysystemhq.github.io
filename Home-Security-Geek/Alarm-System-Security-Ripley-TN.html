Generally, home security systems involve two types, the indoor and outdoor alarm systems. Fire detectors can be heat, smoke or carbon monoxide sensors. Retail, enterprises, and banks & financial institutions, among others, are the leading applications of video surveillance systems due to rise in demand for video security systems in these applications.</p>
<p>The surveillance cameras did nothing to help the man. SD Card - many IP cameras come with SD card storage and the main video footage stored is when there are motions detected.
