<p>But home surveillance cameras that stream video and send alerts via email and text can use up a lot of data on your home network. The Ring Indoor Cam is an affordable smart security camera that delivers sharp 1080p video. Security and safety products such as basic burglar alarm systems , door and window detectors , motion detectors and sirens , are critical components in many security systems.
