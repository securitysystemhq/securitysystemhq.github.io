<p>The most basic burglar alarm systems monitor the perimeter of a home or building for breaches, such as opening a door or breaking a window. We all know that a fire alarm is used to detect smoke or heat - in the form of fire - and alert us to the danger so that we may vacate the presences in enough time to secure our safety. Scene 2: at the same time, in the living room, we lit a bunch of clothes to simulate a fire smoke, boil water in the kitchen to produce water mist, and in the bedroom and the bathroom we did nothing to maintain the normal air state, and we carried out the same number of simulations.</p>
<p>Once the system detects intrusion, the house security system will send a sign either to the local police or to the monitoring company. That's where commercial-grade security camera systems can come in handy. Actually, the wireless CCTV camera type only sends data wirelessly and it still needs a cable for power supply, which set it apart from the truly wire-free CCTV camera types. Video surveillance cameras are available in the price range of $100 to $800 for the most part.</p>
