<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>The Firex is easy to install and can be interconnected with other alarms to create a full-house smoke detection system. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees. The basic plan provides users with three wireless door sensors and one wireless motion sensor. Optex aims at providing products and services to our customers in the fields of security detectors, access control, and industrial equipment, as well as transportation-related and LED lighting control systems.</p>
