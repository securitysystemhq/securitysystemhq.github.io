<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>

Easy to install indoors or out, Arlo smart security cameras give you around-the-clock peace of mind. At $10, the Arlo Smart Premier subscription gives you access to Arlo's e911 feature, which lets you guide emergency responders directly to your home, plus 30 days of cloud storage for up to 10 cameras; the Arlo Elite package ups that to 60 days of storage for up to 20 cameras for $15 per month.</p>

For outdoor, around-the-clock sentry duty, a tough dome camera like this is a safe bet, especially when it's supplied by one of the big hitters of the security industry.</p>
<p>A security company will make more money if you opt for a professionally installed system. Mid-level home security alarms are professional models that are not necessarily monitored by the police, but they are a lot more reliable than DIYs. When you have a home security system professionally monitored, and advertise this by displaying window stickers and yard signs, you're letting burglars know the likelihood they'll fail and be caught are very high.</p>
