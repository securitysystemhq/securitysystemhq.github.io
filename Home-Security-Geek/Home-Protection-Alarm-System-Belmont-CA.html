The Boston bombers were apprehended quickly due to surveillance cameras. One of the more controversial technologies is the video surveillance camera. Whether you manage one location or 1,000, an effective video surveillance system serves as a crime deterrent as well as a key method to capture and document security events on your premises.</p>
<p>For instance, modern systems allow remote communication with the monitoring center. If an automatic fire detection system and a manually operated electrical alarm system are installed in the same workplace, they should normally be incorporated into a single integral system.

<p>These systems connect to a DSL or Cable internet connection and provide the ability to view your cameras over the internet. Surveillance cameras purchased for home use are generally used to help keep an eye on people or objects.

We have mentioned below the main sensors that are usually used in alarm systems which are used to detect and alert in case of a home burglary.</p>
<p>Motion sensing cameras can send an alert to your security company or your smartphone app when they are triggered, allowing you to get a feed just at the moment you need it, rather than all the time. A:Most companies do not give a lot of time when the alarm is first activated to when you personally disarm it. If you haven't disarmed it in this given time frame, the monitoring center would receive your information in about 10 seconds or as specified by your home security company.</p>
<p>Most wireless security cameras operate on the 2.4 Ghz frequency band and have a range between 300 and 600 feet depending on obstructions between the camera and receiving unit. HDCVI cameras also tend to be less expensive and are simpler to install and maintain in large scale surveillance systems. With these devices, you pop a magnet onto your door or window with the sensor and tiny alarm unit nearby. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras only from certain manufacturers and not others.</p>

ADT's six customer monitoring centers (more than any other security company has) make sure your security never goes offline.</p>
