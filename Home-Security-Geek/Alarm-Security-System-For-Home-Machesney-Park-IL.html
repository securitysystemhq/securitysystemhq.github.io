In a protective alarm system, means for creating two light beams extending across an area to be protected, means for converting said beams into electrical energy, means for chopping said beams in such a manner that the output of said converting means is constant and will vary in voltage when one of said beams is modified by an intruder in said area and indicating means responsive to said varying electrical energy.</p>
<p>O2I's remote monitoring and management service is a proactive, real-time, web-based service that works as a set of eyes to constantly oversee the health and condition of your firm's IT infrastructure.

The monitoring company has guards watching the screens 24 hours a day just waiting to receive an alarm distress call. There's also a smartphone app and smart home compatibility built-in as well as optional monitoring from ADT and cellular backup. CP PLUS' extensive portfolio of products include state-of-the-art cameras, DVRs, that is simple to set up and use.</p>

The standard size is 380 TVL to 420 TVL cameras high quality up to 480 TVL to 570 TVL. Few do-it-yourself wired systems contain movement detectors, but they can usually be added as an extra. Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>

Knowing about where the video surveillance cameras should be placed will help you decide which kind of cameras you need. As a pioneer in IP video technology, MOBOTIX set standards in data security.

<p>Video surveillance serves as the remote eyes for management and the security force. And you can use PoE security cameras or WiFi security cameras in areas with access to home WiFi Internet like your driveways, gateways or storefronts.
