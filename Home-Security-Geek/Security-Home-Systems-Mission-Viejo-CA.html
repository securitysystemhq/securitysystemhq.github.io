<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>

Many DIY home security vendors offer the option of buying components by the piece so you can create a custom home alarm system.

As a general rule, all cameras utilized in a security system for after-the-fact investigation and overall deterrence should be recorded and the recording retained in a 10-day library as a minimum.</p>
<p>Whenever there is an unauthorized entry into the house, the system identifies it and alerts by the production of a loud alarm. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. The detector identifies any smoke or heat in the building or if someone uses the manual breakpoint. It is sometimes the case where an alarm panel or wiring is attacked by an intruder and oftentimes the equipment is damaged beyond repair.</p>
