An inexperienced salesmen that doesn't know how to design a security system and thinks a security system only takes 3 doors and a motion sensor because that is how it comes packaged.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly fee ).
