<p>While outdoor cameras are really useful devices, have you ever wondered how they work? Provide cellular connectivity and management support, making them ideal for use in remote patient monitoring, clinical trials or for health visitors and social workers. For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, causing more than 100 of the cameras to go dark. Panic alarms receive police response based on fear of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally receive fire response based on an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>Swansea University has installed a network of Advanced fire alarm control panels to protect its 65-acre, Â£450million Bay campus from the threat of fire. Large chain retailers as well as many small business owners use video surveillance equipment as their first line of defense against theft and vandalism. Not only do our intruder alarm systems act as a deterrent, they also provide a warning that an intrusion is taking place.</p>
