This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems. But the police say it must be as part of a suite of prevention measures because a burglar alarm on its own will not prevent entry to your home”.</p>
