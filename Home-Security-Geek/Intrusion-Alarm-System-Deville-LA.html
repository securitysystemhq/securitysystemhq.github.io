Firstly, it is a lot cheaper than purchasing a professionally made home security video camera; you are looking at around $300+ for a good store purchased system, whereas you can make your own for less than $100.</p>

Systems range from small, self-contained noisemakers, to complicated, multirally systems with computer monitoring and control.
