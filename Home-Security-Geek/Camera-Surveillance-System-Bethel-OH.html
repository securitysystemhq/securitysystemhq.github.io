<p>Most office buildings, school, hospitals and homes today have fire alarm systems installed. Once you've installed your system, simply connect the DVR to your internet router or modem and you can view your cameras anywhere in the world at no additional charge. A bespoke intruder alarm system, supplied and maintained by ClearView, will deter and detect potential intruders to your site.

<p>In this article, we have learned that Fire Alarm systems are fitted in many buildings we encounter every day and that they are used to warn people within the building of an emergency fire-related situation.

Electronic security systems that connect to phone lines are offered by telephone monitoring services that respond to calls. If people know that there are cameras around them, they will most likely not do anything stupid. Connect video cables to the DVR video in ports.</p>

A building fire emergency notification system consisting of audible and visual alarm notification appliances installed within all common-use areas of a building, manual alarm stations installed at every exit from every level, and automatic initiating devices (i.e., smoke detectors, heat detectors, or flame detectors) installed throughout all areas of the building.</p>
<p>In the majority of successful systems, sensors need to be distributed to all areas of the building in order to detect fires in even the most remote corners. The sound activated burglar alarm circuit was constructed in accordance with the circuit designed as illustrated Figure 4. The design was simulated on electronics work bench 11.

Video surveillance security systems are likely to hold the largest share of the home security product market by 2018.</p>
