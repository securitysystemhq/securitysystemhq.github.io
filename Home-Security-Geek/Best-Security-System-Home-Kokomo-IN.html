<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm. Most modern home security systems do not require a landline and rely off of cellular and wireless connectivity.
