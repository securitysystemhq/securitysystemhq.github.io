For microcontroller MC2 , keypad is connected to port 1 and LCD display is connected to port 2 and motor driver is connected to pins P1.2 and P1.3 and touch sensor is connected to pin P1.4. Motion detector is connected to pin P3.3 and taken as a input interrupt (INT1) to the microcontroller 2. The password request switch is connected to pin P3.2 and taken as a input interrupt (INT0) to the microcontroller.</p>

A perimeter arming mode feature will allow for a homeowner to freely circulate at night, inside his home, yet still being the intruder alarm system ready and armed, and continuously monitoring all house perimeter sensors (such as doors and windows detectors), only disregarding the interior motion detectors.</p>
<p>When you are selecting your burglar alarm system, you will have to decide what kind of sensors you want.

The company offers three home security packages; each package is equipped with the basics like the LifeShield base, an entry keypad, door and window sensors and more.</p>
<p>In the majority of successful systems, sensors need to be distributed to all areas of the building in order to detect fires in even the most remote corners. The sound activated burglar alarm circuit was constructed in accordance with the circuit designed as illustrated Figure 4. The design was simulated on electronics work bench 11. The testing followed the modular pattern used in the design with each functional block being tested as described as follows.</p>
<p>Automatic fire alarm systems often play a major role in loss prevention during a fire emergency.

Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>
<p>If the police were called to 2 false alarms in a rolling 12 month period the response will be downgraded to a lower level of police response. To effectively guide people to safety in case of an emergency, fire alarm devices in public and commercial buildings must be carefully matched to local requirements.
