<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
<p>In the case of pan-and-tilt cameras, the camera lens will automatically point itself in the direction of the motion and record. Before secondary and middle school officials install video surveillance systems to prevent vandalism, gang activity, fights, trespassing or theft, they must sit down and conduct a thorough inventory of their needs and security concerns. The STROBE signal is the output from the alarm control panel that will enable the flash lamps from the external sounder.</p>

Kisi is designed to work with the two most used burglar alarm system styles: an integrated alarm system, and a pin code alarm system.
