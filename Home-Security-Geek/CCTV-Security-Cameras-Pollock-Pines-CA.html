<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. There may be no way to avoid the occasional angry or unstable customer, disgruntled employee, parent, violent intruder or disturbed individual, but the installation of a panic system is a great way to mitigate the danger and prepare for it. Wired and wireless solutions from IntraLogic Solutions offer efficient and affordable options, and in many cases leverage existing technology as ready initiating devices.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection.
