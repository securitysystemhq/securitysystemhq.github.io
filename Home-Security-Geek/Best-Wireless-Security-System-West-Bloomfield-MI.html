<p>The importance of a properly installed fire alarm system is not to be overlooked. Along with high resolution images, Matrix IP cameras decrease storage costs by offering latest H.265 Compression technology. Finally, experts state that a home without an alarm system is three times more likely to be burglarized than a home with a professionally monitored system installed. With the latest smart home technology from your favourite security brands, deterring burglars and detecting trespassers has never been easier.</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>
<p>Smart home automation features for a more robust security system.
