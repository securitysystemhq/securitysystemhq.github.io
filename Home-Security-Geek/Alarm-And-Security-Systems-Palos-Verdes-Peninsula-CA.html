They are also known as Night Vision Security cameras that work perfectly well in low light or even no light areas.</p>

If smoke rises beyond the permissible limits, it sends an alarm to the control panel.

You can easily add additional sensors, and removing the system when you move house is a lot less tricky than for wired versions.</p>
