<p>CCTV Security Cameras are the building blocks of any Video Surveillance CCTV camera have positively been able to create a lot of publicity for itself during the modern years. 9. In a protective alarm system, a light source, an optical system for dividing light from said source into a plurality of beams extending across an area to be protected comprising a pair of mirrors and a pair of lenses cooperating therewith, said mirrors deflecting said light to a point in space, a photo-cell for receiving said light, a light chopper for normally passing a constant quantity of light and passing a varying quantity of light when one beam is intercepted by an intruder in said area and signal means responsive to said varying light.</p>
<p>In addition, any attempt to force entry that is detected is forwarded to an alarm control panel, which then reliably sets off a loud alarm and the offender is forced to escape.

Fragmented or uncoordinated devices with individual control interfaces add little value.</p>
