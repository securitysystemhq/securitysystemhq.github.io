It is why more and more healthcare organizations continue to increase their use of video surveillance as part of their overall strategic security plan. While the company's collaboration with Samsung SmartThings was somewhat of a disappointment, the company's new ADT Command platform has loftier ambitions.</p>

Directly attached storage are the hard drives that are located outside of the digital video recorder, network video recorder or server. Some providers have motion sensors that are designed to be pet-friendly, avoiding pets under 80 pounds to help prevent false alarms. Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>
