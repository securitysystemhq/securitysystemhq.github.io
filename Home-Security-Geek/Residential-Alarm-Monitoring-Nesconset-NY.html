However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
<p>D-Link IP based surveillance technology allows users to integrate audio and motion detectors into cameras, without the need for additional hardware and cabling.
