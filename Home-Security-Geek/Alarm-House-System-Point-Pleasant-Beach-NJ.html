Provide cellular connectivity and management support, making them ideal for use in remote patient monitoring, clinical trials or for health visitors and social workers. For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, causing more than 100 of the cameras to go dark. Panic alarms receive police response based on fear of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally receive fire response based on an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness.

A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
