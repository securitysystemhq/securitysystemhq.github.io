In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness. An annual fee is charged for alarm monitoring, this is typically paid directly to the alarm company. All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios. A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system.
