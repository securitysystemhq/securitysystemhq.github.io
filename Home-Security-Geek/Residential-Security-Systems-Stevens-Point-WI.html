<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>

In addition to perimeter sensors, many systems also include motion detectors that monitor large areas inside the house.

<p>Efficiency of burglar alarms depends on the zone triggered, number of zones, time of the day and other aspects installed within the monitoring system. The development of web-based intruder alarm systems from the evolution of the new APIs, and from the new languages based on the web 2.0 philosophy are now giving better ways and tools to design intruder alarm systems and to increase security - the road ahead to follow.</p>

You can also connect the dome camera to your PC via the usb cable to view all the recorded videos. In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. While there are some legitimate uses (nanny cams,‚Äù employee monitoring, and so on), the low cost and the ease of use means that the capability to perform surveillance by amateurs is a very real and a danger to almost anyone.</p>

<p>The most important characteristics of an effective burglar alarm system are its accuracy in identifying the correct alarm outputs to assure quick and correct responses and the unit's accuracy in communicating with the security service provider. From a practical perspective, wireless systems have more flexibility if you may move or don't want to put holes in walls. Most of our surveillance systems include DVR viewer software for Windows and Mac PCs, as well as mobile surveillance viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.</p>
