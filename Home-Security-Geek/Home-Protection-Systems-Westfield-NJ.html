Various sensors like Motion sensor, flame detector and touch sensor are interfaced to the system. When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble.

Several cities feed video surveillance into monitoring headquarters, often referred to as domain awareness centers” or real-time crime centers.” Some hope to expand the footage they collect through their own surveillance cameras by also tapping into footage taken by private individuals and businesses. Wired cameras are hard wired to the security system, meaning you need to physically string power and data cables from a central hub or recording device to each individual camera.</p>
<p>The basic residential detection system, according to NFPA 74, relies primarily on the use of smoke detectors. It supports temperature, humidity and dust accumulation drift compensation and sensor fault inspection (fault reporting to fire alarm control panel).

An annunciator panel is sometimes employed to monitor the status of the different areas in a designated fire zone for theft protection and control of a facility's alarm devices. Usually the microphonic detection systems are installed as sensor cables attached to rigid chainwire fences, however some specialised versions of these systems can also be installed as buried systems underground.</p>
<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>
