Solving Cases - Number 3 brings us here; if the cameras do not work as a crime deterrent, then the footage video surveillance systems capture can be used as evidence and help ensure that the proper arrests and prosecutions are made in case of a theft, vandalism or assault. The National Electrical Code covers the equipment and wiring of fire alarm systems.

Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>The newest technology in camera surveillance is the use of computers to interpret the data. The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device.
