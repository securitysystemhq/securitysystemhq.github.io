<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>These cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. This isn't the cheapest package Protect America offers, but we think it provides solid home security that's still affordable. Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>
<p>Ask the home security company for an itemized breakdown of all charges, which may include equipment costs, installation fees, monthly monitoring charges and more. The Digital Video Recorder also known as a DVR is used to take footage or video taken by a security camera and storing it as the name says, digitally, onto a hard drive. The camera uses a number of sensors to detect the presence of a person in the room and monitor their activities.</p>
