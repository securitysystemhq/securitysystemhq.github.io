Stability for the Ultra Series NVRs is ensured by using RAID and N+1 hot spare, ensuring smooth and reliable video streaming and recording. All installed components, including sensors, are linked to a control panel. A few years ago, you'd need to budget thousands in order to create a video monitoring, web-connected, home security system, but today you can install a few affordable wireless sensors, a connected motion-sensing camera and enjoy 24-7 home monitoring, with alerts sent direct to your phone from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe promoted the use of CCTV , saying that cameras should be installed by homeowners and businesses to help detectives solve crimes. If your CCTV security cameras at home are positioned in all possible entries a thief might use, the likelihood of recording their movements, their physical build, and even their faces are high but seizing them on the spot before they can cry uncle is not always successful.</p>

A perimeter arming mode feature will allow for a homeowner to freely circulate at night, inside his home, yet still being the intruder alarm system ready and armed, and continuously monitoring all house perimeter sensors (such as doors and windows detectors), only disregarding the interior motion detectors.</p>
