<p>Experts believe that CCTV discourages opportunistic crime, where an offender spontaneously takes advantage of a situation. Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>
<p>We offer comprehensive support for complete fire protection, testing and inspecting detection and alarm as well as sprinkler and hydrant systems.

The aim of fire alarm systems is to warn people of an emergency. Each of these cameras is equipped with different functions and features and is used for specific purposes. To fine tune even further the motion sensing capability, the surveillance cameras can be programmed to deaden parts of the sensor field so that small animals or little kids playing won't trigger the devices.</p>
<p>We also found it easy to set up, scalable to small and large homes, and configurable with a variety of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors. In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars.

A portable system is one that is wireless and usually a DIY installation. Homes without security systems are high on their list. A basic intruder alarm system consists of a control panel, with rechargeable battery power backup and internal or external keypads, several interior and perimeter intrusion detectors, and one external sounder, at least.</p>
