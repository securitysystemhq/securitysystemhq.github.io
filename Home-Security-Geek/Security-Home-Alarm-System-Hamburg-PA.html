However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>

No doubt, a video surveillance camera system does deter criminals. In many cases, they can do more than just tell them that there has been an alarm in the building; they can be directed by the kind of alarm and where the alarm is.
