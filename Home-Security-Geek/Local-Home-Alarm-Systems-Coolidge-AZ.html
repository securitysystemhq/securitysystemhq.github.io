<p>The company wanted to create a comprehensive security device without using wi-fi-connected cameras, which are controversial but increasingly common thanks to product families like the Google-owned Nest and Amazon's Ring. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Also, many of these systems can integrate with other smart-home devices, such as thermostats, locks, and light bulbs. With support for over 2,500 security camera models and related encoders-plus virtualization, centralization, and integration with the most popular access control systems-our video surveillance solutions provide a wide range of benefits to meet your organization's video security demands. Apart from homes and business premises, security cameras have many other applications; they can be used in different places to monitor and prevent criminal activities.</p>
