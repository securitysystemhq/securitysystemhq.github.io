<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>If something sets off the alarm, the company that is monitoring it will alert the local police to address the situation. Monitoreal needs to be on your home network in order to see your cameras.

<p>Fire protection systems are complex safety systems, which must be absolutely reliable in case of emergency.
