<p>Having a CCTV camera installed in your residential and commercial areas is not a new thing. Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them — from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>
<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it. The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>Smart home automation features for a more robust security system. Fire-alarm control panels (FACP) or fire-alarm control units (FACU) consist of electric panels that function as the controlling components of a fire-alarm system Figure 9.35). On the contrary, some security camera providers offer cloud storage monthly plans to securely store videos on the cloud. Alert systems can also close fire doors, recall elevators, and interface and monitor the installed suppression systems, such as sprinklers.</p>

Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>
<p>This provides an added level of protection against inadvertent discharge, and for this reason, these systems are frequently employed in water sensitive environments such as archival vaults, fine art storage rooms, rare book libraries and computer centers. These aren't cheap: The company's own video doorbell costs $250 (including installation), while a self-installed video doorbell from Ring will cost you about $180 Vivint offers financing, which allows you to spread the up-front cost over time with a multiple year-contract, and told us that most customers go with this option.</p>
