The following regulatory documents apply to the fire alarm system as opposed to individual smoke alarms of the residential type, even when they are AC powered and used for group operation. An inexperienced salesmen that doesn't know how to design a security system and thinks a security system only takes 3 doors and a motion sensor because that is how it comes packaged.</p>

CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. And the design must address critical interconnected emergency control equipment and wiring to fans, dampers, smoke control equipment, and elevators.</p>
<p>This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. In rural applications, where reliable sprinkler water supplies can be expensive, mist systems may be comparable or less than standard sprinklers.</p>
