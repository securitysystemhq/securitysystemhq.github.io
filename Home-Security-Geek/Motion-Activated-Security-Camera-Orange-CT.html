<p>Hidden cameras are becoming more of a compulsory for ATM machines and banks as they help in catching fraudulent people red handed. Even given their life safety nature fire alarm systems are starting to utilize IP-based functionality and should be integrated with other systems within a smart building. Compared to burglar alarms some years back, home security systems today are highly advanced and a lot of sophisticated.</p>
<p>If the fire alarm system is addressable, the source of the occurrence will be pointed on the control panel. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Today, due to different technological advancements, video surveillance cameras are better than ever and can now be used with computers for more complex situations.</p>

<p>With budget challenges and the inability to put more officers on the street, cameras become the eyesâ of the City and are a cost effective way to improve public safety in the City.
