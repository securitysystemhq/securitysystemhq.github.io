Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>

<p>Your alarms can also be remotely monitored in compliance with police and insurance requirements. As of late, Hikvision and Sony propelled day and night security cameras which use double lighting system.

As tempting as it might be, avoid any of the too-good-to-be-true” security cameras from companies like Geeni or brandless devices available en masse on Amazon.</p>
<p>Because the DVR you choose will be recording the images your security system captures, it's as important a part of the total system as the cameras themselves. CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes.

<p>Modern technology has made it possible to access the videos from these CCTV security systems live on phones. So if you choose to do the installation yourself and you are not technically inclined, you might specifically look for a security system that is wireless and known for being easy to install. Before attempting to understand fire detection systems and automatic sprinklers, it is beneficial to possess a basic knowledge of fire development and behavior.</p>
