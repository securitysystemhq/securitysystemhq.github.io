<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>When it comes to a closed-circuit, no energy means alarms sound immediately. This uses the latest innovations in video compression technology to provide high resolution video quality from the smallest amount of video data required. Fire alarm systems typically consist of several inter-linked components, such as smoke detectors, heat detector, carbon monoxide, manual call points, sounders, alarm and buzzer. Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>

The panel will then activate one or more signaling circuits to sound building alarms and summon emergency help. To further complicate the situation, there are many local security dealers that do not advertise the brand name that will be doing the monitoring.</p>
<p>Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. These cameras cost less than digital cameras, but because their field of vision is smaller, more cameras may be needed.</p>
