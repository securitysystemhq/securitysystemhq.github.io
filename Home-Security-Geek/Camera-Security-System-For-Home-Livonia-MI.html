<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety. In fact, I can't recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire. In the event of an intrusion or life safety event, the alarm siren on the ADT Security Hub will be activated and an alert will be sent to your smartphone but ADT will not be notified.</p>

The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device.

<p>If you travel often, your needs will focus more on being able to remotely access, monitor, and control your home security and home automation features. Multiplex operation enables simultaneous user operations of the security camera DVR. Councils, law enforcement and security management professionals in the UK rely heavily on video surveillance as a tool to fight crime and prevent terrorism.
