<p>Every now and then you may find yourself in a position where one of your security cameras has stopped working. They can perform all the functions of a digital video recorder mentioned above and adds support for IP and megapixel cameras. Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services. Fire safety begins with fire detection, and fire detection means everything from components—sensors, initiating devices, annunciators, and control panels—to integrated systems.</p>
<p>Think of the alarm system connected to the door. Security cameras can keep an eye out for criminal activity, but they also give family members the ability to monitor the person and the home remotely.
