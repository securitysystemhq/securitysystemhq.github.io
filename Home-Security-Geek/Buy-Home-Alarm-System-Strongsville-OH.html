<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>We offer comprehensive support for complete fire protection, testing and inspecting detection and alarm as well as sprinkler and hydrant systems.

<p>Detection devices run the gamut, from smoke detectors and heat detectors to multi-capability detectors, which contain a number of functions in one detector. Most companies also offer yard signs and window decals to warn potential burglars that a house is protected by an alarm service. Alternatively, your building's security system could consist of nothing more than a couple bubble cameras that only monitor hallways and office entries.</p>

These fire alarm systems are identical to an L3 system but with additional detection in an area where there is a high chance of ignition (e.g., kitchen) or where the risk to people is particularly increased (e.g., sleeping risk).</p>
