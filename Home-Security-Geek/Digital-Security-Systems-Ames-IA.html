<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>

Panasonic Security constantly endeavor to ensure that our products and technologies are packed with the latest, most innovative technologies to ensure that our customers and their businesses are able to achieve maximum benefit from their IP security camera systems.

These systems can be installed in less than 2 hours so you can be up and running the same day.</p>
<p>I will focused on standard CCTV monitor, standalone DVR recorder and distribution power supply, as this is the most popular and likely solution for most CCTV installations. Look for models with multiple sensors - motion and heat for instance - that helps to reduce the number of false alerts. A typical fire alarm system has numerous initiating devices divided among separate zones â€” each connected via an initiating device circuit to a central control panel.</p>
