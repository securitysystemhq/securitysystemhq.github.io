Currently, no DIY home security systems work with HomeKit, but if you're a Google Home owner, you may prefer to choose one of our other picks.

<p>We need one video cable to connect the DVR with the monitor, if you do not have one you may cut piece of Siamese cable separate the power conductors from it and install BNC connectors on both ends, you now have the cable. Yet there's such a wide array of home security options available to the homeowner, from CCTV and security cameras, to monitoring solutions, it can all seem overwhelming.
