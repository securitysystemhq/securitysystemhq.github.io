It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.

<p>Lynx Security are experts in burglar alarm systems and can help you find a system that is perfect for protecting your property - domestic or commercial.

<p>This is totally untrue that CCTV cameras can be crime solver as CCTV cameras can only reduce the crime by capturing the on going scene.
