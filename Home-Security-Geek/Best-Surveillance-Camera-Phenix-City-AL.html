In a protective alarm system, a light source, an optical system for dividing light from said source into a plurality of beams extending across an area to be protected comprising a pair of mirrors and a pair of lenses cooperating therewith, said mirrors deflecting said light to a point in space, a photo-cell for receiving said light, a light chopper for normally passing a constant quantity of light and passing a varying quantity of light when one beam is intercepted by an intruder in said area and signal means responsive to said varying light.</p>

Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
<p>More recently, decentralized IP cameras , perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation. It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.

<p>Lynx Security are experts in burglar alarm systems and can help you find a system that is perfect for protecting your property - domestic or commercial.

<p>This is totally untrue that CCTV cameras can be crime solver as CCTV cameras can only reduce the crime by capturing the on going scene. The essence of a fire alarm system, as opposed to individual smoke detectors, even if they are wired to indicate in concert, is that it is supervised from a central location. In the past you'd need deep pockets to have a Yale system professionally installed (and then monitored for an extra cost) but the Smart Living range is DIY, wireless and app-controlled.</p>
