Automatic fire alarm system and hybrid fire detection system with the smoke detectors provide you safety with modern security and safety system with emergency fire security sound systems. Bullet security cameras are the most common CCTV camera type that you can normally see on the street, the supermarket, and the neighborhood. Another great feature is a backup battery installed in the home's alarm keypad to ensure the system will continue to function even if electrical power is lost.</p>
<p>We are expert in providing cutting edge technology in security & surveillance domain. Infrared - With IR illuminators fitted available in some Dome Cameras, video images even in badly illuminated conditions can be captured. North America is in the forefront in the evolution and development of alarm monitoring technology as this region is home to some of the largest multinational corporations in the world. Apart from your workplace, you can also install these cameras inside your homes, just to enhance the security of your place.</p>
<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>

Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
<p>The P category refers to systems installed throughout office spaces and building premises. All home monitoring cameras are password-protected. All signals converge in the fire alarm control panel which sets off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department. While the fire alarm panel may cost a little bit more than smoke alarms, it certainly offers much more safety and protection for your home and your family.</p>

<p>Network cameras are ideal for both domestic and commercial purposes because you can see what's going on whilst away from the property. Digital cameras are also available in "smart" models that are equipped with motion detection software that captures any movement that is untimely or is unusual.
