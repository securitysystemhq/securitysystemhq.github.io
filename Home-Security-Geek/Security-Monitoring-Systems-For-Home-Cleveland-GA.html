Position your cameras strategically around the premises you want to monitor. First, there is no such thing as free home security monitoring, nor would the top security companies get together on a cross promotional activity, since they are direct competitors. So create certain that you get a home security system that can effectively protect your home and family anytime of the day, whether or not you are at home or not.</p>
