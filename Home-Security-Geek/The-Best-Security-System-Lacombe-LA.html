<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>

A CCTV unit will need to be installed by a professional, but if you own a very large property then the cost is definitely worth it. They can be placed both externally and internally and the DVR playback is easy and straightforward.</p>
<p>Brinks Home Security, one of the established names in the industry, recently received a facelift after MONI Smart Security purchased the name rights to the company and gave the company a serious overhaul. There is a delay of several seconds which allows the homeowner time to enter the property and key in the security code to turn the system off. To extend the backup time only plug the DVR and camera power supply to the backup unit and the monitor to regular power strip, this way if we do loose power for some time the DVR and cameras are still functioning as normal while monitor is off.</p>
