<p>Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China's per person camera penetration rate Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone.

<p>Whilst IP CCTV has been available for around 10 years, it is only in the last few years that the technology has matured, leading to the developments in Megapixel and High Definition (HD) technology.
