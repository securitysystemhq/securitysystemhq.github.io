<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Professional monitoring generally carries a monthly cost on top of your equipment cost. Best Home Security Systems With Cameras - Security cameras help deter and solve crimes, plus owners find them useful as baby monitors and for pet surveillance. Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems are user-installed (DIY), some companies offer or require professional installation.

<p>All countries with a population of at least 250,000 are using some form of AI surveillance systems to monitor their citizens, says Steven Feldstein from the US think tank Carnegie And it is China that dominates this market - accounting for 45% of the sector's global revenue.

That's where commercial-grade security camera systems can come in handy. Actually, the wireless CCTV camera type only sends data wirelessly and it still needs a cable for power supply, which set it apart from the truly wire-free CCTV camera types.
