<p>When choosing a video surveillance system, you want to go with the best video quality for the buck, and with a Network IP camera, there are 10 reasons why you should consider them over 20th century CCTV cameras. However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan. Dome cameras are typically used for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The central module connects at the Internet via WiFi and through an application we can remotely monitor the state of the house or control various devices within the enclosure. Abode's small scale makes it easy to forgo professional monitoring, especially if your main goal is to stay connected to what's happening at home instead of deterring intruders.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home.

Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>
