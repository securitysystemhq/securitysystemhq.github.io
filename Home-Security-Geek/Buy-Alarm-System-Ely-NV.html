<p>Digital Security surveillance cameras are much smaller. Our top picks for security cameras will send alerts to your phone when they detect motion, be able to record in HD quality even at night, and are designed to withstand any type of weather. Recently, manufacturers have begun to introduce and market smoke detectors that combine ionization and photoelectric sensors in the same unit.

<p>Frontpoint offers great customer service and the best DIY installation experience. For Home Owners: CCTV Security cameras help the owners to constantly monitor the activities going on in their home. C-mount cameras can cover distances beyond 40 ft thanks to the possibility to use special lenses with these cameras, whereas standard CCTV lenses can only cover distances of 35-40 ft. It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing.</p>
<p>In a closed circuit system, the electric circuit is completed when the door is shut. Reolink develops connected cameras that can be used for house monitoring applications.
