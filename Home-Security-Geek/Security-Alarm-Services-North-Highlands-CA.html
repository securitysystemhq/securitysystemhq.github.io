Most outdoor cameras are fairly easy to install but you might need to call in an electrician. If you are worried that your home can be robbed, it is a good idea to go for a combination intruder and fire monitoring service. This means that all programming and "decisions" that an alarm panel has to make when it detects an intruder is all contained within the electronic circuit board that is installed in the home or business.</p>
<p>This is a kind of artificial intelligence that is called "video analytics", and is potentially beneficial for efficient use of surveillance cameras, but this technology has sometimes been significantly oversold by the surveillance camera industry. But, according to security experts, pound-for-pound, having a monitored home alarm security system, which they strongly emphasize MUST be a good and reliable brand, is perhaps the best and SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION that one could institute in having a home that scares away potential burglars and keeps them away from your home, and your family safety.</p>

<p>Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
