Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>

<p>From there, determining which security cameras to purchase is made easier with our Security Cameras Buying Guide All the rage, smart security cameras are very convenient option.
