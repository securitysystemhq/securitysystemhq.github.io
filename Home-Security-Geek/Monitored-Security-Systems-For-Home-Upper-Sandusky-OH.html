<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>We may request a written statement or report from a registered alarm company representative, which details the reasons for the false alarm. Many DIY home security vendors offer the option of buying components by the piece so you can create a custom home alarm system. We manufacture all the products we carry, and all our cameras and recorders come with a 1-3 year warranty, and are supported by knowledgeable support professionals located in the USA.</p>

Additionally, what could be controlled through a smart phone app and whether there were false alarms and fast response times were deemed important as well.</p>
