A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>
<p>When your alarm is activated the security guards alarm monitoring screen will flash to advise that your home security has been breached.

Security cameras that are equipped with motion sensors give them the capability of detecting movements. Other common causes for false alarms can relate to the system technology.
