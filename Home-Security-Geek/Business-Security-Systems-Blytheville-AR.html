<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras.

<p>Wyze cameras are especially popular among folks who want simple security for dropping in. However, they do require microSD cards to record footage and can be a bit slow to log on and check-in after receiving a push notification. These are essential devices to look for when purchasing a DIY security system. We offer complete HD security camera systems that include a DVR, cameras, cables, connectors and power supplies.</p>

<p>Whenever there is an unauthorized entry into the house, the system identifies it and alerts by the production of a loud alarm.

It is sometimes the case where an alarm panel or wiring is attacked by an intruder and oftentimes the equipment is damaged beyond repair.</p>
