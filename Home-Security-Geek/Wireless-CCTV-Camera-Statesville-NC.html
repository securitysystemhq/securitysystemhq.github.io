<p>The most basic burglar alarm systems monitor the perimeter of a home or building for breaches, such as opening a door or breaking a window. We all know that a fire alarm is used to detect smoke or heat - in the form of fire - and alert us to the danger so that we may vacate the presences in enough time to secure our safety.

<p>The video feed of the camera is then transmitted to a monitor or sets of monitors which you can easily view and record for surveillance purposes. For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped.
