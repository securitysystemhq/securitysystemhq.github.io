<p>If a detector recognizes a condition which could be indicative of a fire, the control panel will first attempt a quick reset. Rather than initiating an alarm state, the control panel will go into a supervisory” state, if a sprinkler valve is in an off-normal” condition.

Motion detection recording means only record when video camera detect movement, then it will start to record, no motion, then no record. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, but it's not so much when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity.</p>
