<p>Video: Big security operation centers where a lot of cameras must be examined or scrutinized, video wall viewing is generally preferred. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image.
