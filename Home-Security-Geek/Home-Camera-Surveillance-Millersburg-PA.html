Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first.

<p>A: A DIY burglar alarm may work like any other conventional burglar alarms, but with the added benefit of using sensors and components that you consider necessary. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that may show a 360-degree view, but the best security cameras have a view of at least 100 degrees or better.
