Devices that come with the SimpliSafe system include the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensor and HD video quality, and a keychain remote used to arm or disarm the system. Your alarm-monitoring company may offer discounts. Video surveillance has become an integral part of businesses and law enforcement agencies that use these cameras extensively.</p>
