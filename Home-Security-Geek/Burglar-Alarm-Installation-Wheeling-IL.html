From interior cameras to rugged, outdoor cameras with zoomable lenses, camera types and abilities vary.</p>
<p>When your alarm is activated the security guards alarm monitoring screen will flash to advise that your home security has been breached.

Arlo builds great home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of.
