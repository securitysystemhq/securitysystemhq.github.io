A good know-how of the security systems market will help you buy the most appropriate security system for your home. Pro Series DVRs support HD videos, H.265 Pro+ and H.265 encoding technology, 4K resolution output, power over coax (PoC), multiple VCA events, and more.

If you have the extra bandwidth on your network, the higher quality video and easier setup of NVR is likely the best choice.</p>
