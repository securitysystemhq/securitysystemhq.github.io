Security has already reached a new level as the technology of the present times has advanced to unprecedented heights. Our selection includes motion detectors, line detectors and laser detectors for both indoors and outdoors manufactured by Optex, Risco, Bosch and Visonic.</p>
<p>Commercial smoke detectors are different than home detectors in that they will send a signal to the fire alarm system instead of an alarm from the detector itself. But there are also several drawbacks when you opt to use a smoke alarm instead of the fire alarm panel.

You can easily add additional sensors, and removing the system when you move house is a lot less tricky than for wired versions.</p>

<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is one of the most common sensors found in household and small business environments. An important component of the video system is the analog or digital video signal transmission means from the camera to the remote site and to the monitoring and recording site.
