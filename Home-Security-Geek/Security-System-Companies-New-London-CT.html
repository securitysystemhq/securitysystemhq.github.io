<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>When it comes to a closed-circuit, no energy means alarms sound immediately. This uses the latest innovations in video compression technology to provide high resolution video quality from the smallest amount of video data required. Fire alarm systems typically consist of several inter-linked components, such as smoke detectors, heat detector, carbon monoxide, manual call points, sounders, alarm and buzzer. Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>
