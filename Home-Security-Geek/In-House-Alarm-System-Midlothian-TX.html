<p>The siren and lights will alert the householder or neighbors that someone has broken into the house and the sound will often drive the intruder to run away quickly.

Ring Alarm Security System packs the power of whole-home security into an affordable, DIY package. But a security camera system around the house can see people who approach the front door and maybe even catch a criminal in the act of breaking in. Most of Outdoor CCTV is equipped with a casing to protect the it against rain, dust, and extreme temperatures.</p>
