<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The Firex is easy to install and can be interconnected with other alarms to create a full-house smoke detection system. This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees.

<h2>Home Security Solutions Salem West Virginia</h2>
<p>Help secure your home with a smart security camera and motion sensors. In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras connected—either hardwired or wireless— to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. However, it is important to ensure the reliability and safe operation of fire-fighting equipment and installed systems such as fire alarms and emergency lighting.</p>
<p>IP video cameras operate by providing a video feed through your high-speed Internet connection. The alarm effectiveness depends on the type of zone being triggered, zone's number, time within a certain day, and other installed aspects in the monitoring scheme.

<p>The signals that are sending by the alarm system are received by the monitoring centers and thus inform the cops to take immediate action against burglar. In the event of a home intrusion when this type of security system is installed, a high-decibel alarm sounds (provided one is installed). A recording device and a monitor will enable you to store and also view all footage that is recorded in the DVR or the digital video recorder.</p>
