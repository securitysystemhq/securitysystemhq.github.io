The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>

Professional monitoring gives you peace of mind during an alarm, no matter where you are. Add sensors using your phone's camera by scanning the QR code present behind the sensor. An individual (not a business or organization), may record a conversation as long as one of the participants has consented to the recording.</p>
<p>In addition to having the best full-service DIY installation option, Frontpoint is known for the way it takes care of its customers. A jaw-dropping 80% of theft occurs in businesses with less than 100 employees.1 So if you're running a small to mid-sized business, investing in a video surveillance system may be just the deterrent you need.
