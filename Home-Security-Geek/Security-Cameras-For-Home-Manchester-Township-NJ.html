<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time.

As you can guess, with alarm monitoring worth so much, many of the family run alarm companies cashed out long ago. Among the biggest decisions to make when deciding which home security company to choose is whether you want to install it yourself or have a professional do it. Some people love the idea that they can install the system themselves, while others are concerned about being able to do the installation correctly.</p>
