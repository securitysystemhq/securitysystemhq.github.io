<p>All buildings need to have fire safety equipment in order to ensure the safety of the people who occupy the building. Instead, it wirelessly transmits the video signal to a wireless receiver that is connected to your recording or viewing device. A few more advanced home security camera systems like our Alnet PC-Based DVR Systems and H.264 standalone DVR systems provide advanced remote viewing features that will even allow you to remotely record video to a PC over the internet. They are equipped with ½” CMOS progressive scan sensors which allows the device to pick up high-quality images and doesn't require an extra light source - which makes the perfect night time security surveillance camera.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>The user is also notified about any movement using data from the camera's motion sensor. The most common burglar alarm sensors can indicate the opening of a window or door. Heat detectors. The software provided by DVR manufacturers is proprietary to the DVR unit and the ability to retrieve files chronologically or based on certain security events is vital to the DVR product.

<p>So the alarm vendors have reacted to the queries and qualms of pet owners about the problem of pets setting off a false alarm, and designed burglar-alarm that take pets into consideration.
