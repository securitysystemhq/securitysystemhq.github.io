Home security has never been as easy and effortless as it is with the ADT Control app.</p>
<p>Security systems that support home automation tend to be more expensive than simpler ones, so don't feel compelled to purchase a security system with features you won't use. In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. If you are looking for a comprehensive view of a large open area while having the ability to focus and zoom in for details at the same time, then Turbo HD PTZ Cameras are the perfect candidate.</p>

Pick between a full spectrum of intrusion protection, activity detection and environmental monitoring devices. The electronics of the detectors analyzes both signals and triggers an alarm only in the case of simultaneous detection of an intruder.</p>

A traditional wired system will need to be installed by a professional, and often requires some drilling (and holes in your walls) to connect the sensors to the main alarm system. Responding to false alarms can consume thousands of personnel hours at a cost to taxpayers and place the safety of citizens truly in need of law enforcement response in jeopardy.</p>
