<p>When you're looking for the best alarms and home security systems, these resources and tips will help you protect your home. A:There could be two situations in which a burglar alarm might be causing this nuisance: The volume is too high, or the neighbor's alarm went off and no one is doing anything about it. In the first scenario, try contacting your alarm company for information on how to do the following: • Lower the volume • Reduce the time for which the alarm sounds before silencing automatically • Change the tone of the alarm to something less sharp or high pitched Knowing these things will help you control any noise that might be irritating.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
