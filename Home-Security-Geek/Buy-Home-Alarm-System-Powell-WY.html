<p>Installing a CCTV camera can sometimes be difficult and sometimes be easy. A security alarm system does not really intend to help property owners or residents to catch thieves.

<p>These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible. The motion detectors for indoors are suitable for stores, offices, public facilities and residential buildings, in addition to manufacturing, machine shops and garages, for example. Disadvantages: expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost), and a high rate of false alarms as it cannot distinguish some pets from humans.</p>
<p>IP networks allow for more intelligence for surveillance than legacy analog networks. With the start of 2010, many research labs, such as Kiwi Security Labs, started to broadcast the Advanced Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems” (AIVSS). Keep sensors and motion detectors clean and dust-free as dirt build-up can cause them to trigger the alarm. The system allows you to effectively monitor multiple locations at the same time, and requires no manpower to capture the video.</p>
