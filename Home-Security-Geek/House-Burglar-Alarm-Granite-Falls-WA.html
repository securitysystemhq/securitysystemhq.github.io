All of the systems in this article are installed by professionals, which are good for those who don't have the time, patience, or expertise to install all the requisite sensors and equipment.

You can usually tweak the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent false alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off during certain hours of the day. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>A fire alarm panel is generally pricier than its more traditional counterpart, which is the smoke alarm. Home security companies are giving customers plenty of choices for equipment and services. They include some home alarms, maybe some security cameras, and definitely some non lethal self defense weapons to protect you and your family from a home invader.
