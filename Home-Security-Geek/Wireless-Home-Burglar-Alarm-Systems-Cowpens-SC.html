<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>Every system comes with a free app that allows you to view your cameras anywhere in the world as long as you have internet. Position your cameras strategically around the premises you want to monitor. First, there is no such thing as free home security monitoring, nor would the top security companies get together on a cross promotional activity, since they are direct competitors. So create certain that you get a home security system that can effectively protect your home and family anytime of the day, whether or not you are at home or not.</p>
<p>The cameras deter crime and may lead some students to confess to infractions that weren't even caught on the security cameras. As mentioned, there is no need for a subscription plan, though there are contract-free Ring Protect Plans available, for either $3 or $10 a month, which allow you to store more video using the Ring app, as well as access member benefits and discounts on additional security product purchases.</p>
