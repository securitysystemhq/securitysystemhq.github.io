<p>Having a CCTV camera installed in your residential and commercial areas is not a new thing. Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them — from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>
<p>The cameras perform different functions depending on the type of surveillance system being used. They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it.

<p>There are two types of cameras used for surveillance - analog and IP (internet protocol), which are digital cameras. IP camera, is a kind of computerized camcorder usually utilized for reconnaissance and which, is not like simple shut circuit TV (CCTV) cameras, can send and get information by means of a PC network and the Internet. Box surveillance camera is an ultra-high-resolution CCTV camera made with the new image sensor processor which is capable of capturing video at 700 TV lines of resolution in color and black & white, 960H CCTV resolution.</p>
<p>Most outdoor cameras, like our current top pick, the Arlo Ultra , offer motion detection with push and email notifications, night vision, and cloud storage for event-triggered video, and some, like the Ring Floodlight Cam , pull double duty as floodlights or porch lights. These can be photoelectric smoke and heat detectors, ionization smoke detectors, heat detectors, in-duct smoke detectors, manually operated pull stations and sprinkler waterflow sensors.</p>
<p>It is the most effective and versatile automated CCTV surveillance camera system, with modular plug-and-play hardware for all types of application and environment. This enables the camera to send good quality images at very low light levels, although they will be in black and white when the infra-red lighting is being used, which is a side-effect of this type of light.

The aim of fire alarm systems is to warn people of an emergency. Each of these cameras is equipped with different functions and features and is used for specific purposes. To fine tune even further the motion sensing capability, the surveillance cameras can be programmed to deaden parts of the sensor field so that small animals or little kids playing won't trigger the devices.</p>
<p>We also found it easy to set up, scalable to small and large homes, and configurable with a variety of accessories, from entry and motion detectors to fire and CO sensors to leak and temperature sensors. In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars. Not that long ago, the only folks that could afford security cameras were James Bond, NASA and the police.</p>
<p>Although DIY home security systems are designed to be installed by non-technical homeowners, some people don't want to or can't install the system.
