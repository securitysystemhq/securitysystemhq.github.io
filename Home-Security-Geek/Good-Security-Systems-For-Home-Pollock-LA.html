<p>One of the first decisions that you'll need to make is if you need a wireless or wired security camera system, and the correct answer likely depends on where you intend to place the cameras and components.

<p>The camera is developed using a binocular camera with a 165-degree field of view and infrared sensors for night vision.

The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station.</p>
