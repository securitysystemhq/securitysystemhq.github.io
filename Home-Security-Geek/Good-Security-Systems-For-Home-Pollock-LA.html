<p>One of the first decisions that you'll need to make is if you need a wireless or wired security camera system, and the correct answer likely depends on where you intend to place the cameras and components.

Note that even where Guard response is not available, you can still benefit from our home monitoring services.</p>

<p>The camera is developed using a binocular camera with a 165-degree field of view and infrared sensors for night vision.

Rising demand for video surveillance and video security systems from verticals such as commercial facilities and city surveillance drives the growth of market.</p>

When the circuit is broken, the Control Panel will either sound an audible alarm or alert the security company - in some cases, both.</p>

The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station.</p>
