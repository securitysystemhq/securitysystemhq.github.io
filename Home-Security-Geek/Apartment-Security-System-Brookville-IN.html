They are small, portable, and can often be programmed so you can view surveillance footage via the internet, which means you can even check on your home while you're on vacation. It's also used by the control panel to monitor the state (alarm or no alarm) of the initiating devices and zone wiring. The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly—the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage).</p>

The motion detectors for indoors are suitable for stores, offices, public facilities and residential buildings, in addition to manufacturing, machine shops and garages, for example. Disadvantages: expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost), and a high rate of false alarms as it cannot distinguish some pets from humans.</p>
