<p>Indoor cameras are designed to sit inside and monitor an area. Several security systems offer integrations with popular voice activation hubs like Amazon Alexa, but experts predict companies that are moving toward voice controls will become obsolete. That means you can add, for example, a smart speaker to arm, disarm, and check system status with the sound of your voice, as well as trigger cameras or lights to go on based on alerts or your location.</p>
<p>Dome security cameras are designed to conceal the true orientation of the camera. The ADT alarm systems are really effective against a break-in by an unknown stranger and one can really count on it during a loot or robbery at one's house. Depending on the home security system you choose, motion sensors can send alerts to your phones or a monitoring center.
