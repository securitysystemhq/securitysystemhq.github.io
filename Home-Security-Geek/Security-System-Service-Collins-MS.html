<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it. The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>Digital Video Recorders accepts only analog camera feeds as inputs and supports remote viewing over the Internet. So whether you choose a DIY home security system or opt for the traditional route, a home alarm system is a smart investment. Here's our 2018 video surveillance buyer's guide to help break down the component parts of video surveillance systems. Here's a list of just some of the home alarm systems providers Fort Knox® can upgrade & monitor: ADT, Honeywell, Xfinity, Ademco, DSC, Go Control, GE Security, AT&T Digital Life, First Alert, Interlogix, and Napco.</p>

<p>The EZVIZ outdoor security camera uses a 360-degree swivel mounted from the ceiling to show all angles of your home. It makes high-end equipment, it offers a bunch of smart home devices, and it's ahead of the curve when it comes to innovative features. Perhaps this is no better demonstrated than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had changed since he took on the role in 2014, with the growth of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more.</p>
