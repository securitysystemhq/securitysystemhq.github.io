There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>

It's disappointing that the Yi Outdoor Camera doesn't have the people alerts that are on the company's indoor camera, since those could really cut down on notifications of bugs and car lights.</p>
<p>Most have motion detection settings that only record footage when the camera detects movement. However, with the proper placement of the wireless sensors in your home, your wireless home security alarm system will be just as secure - if not more - than a hardwired system. There are also alarm systems which could be accessed from a remote location allowing you to see what is going on around. This could come in different types and one good example is a CCTV security system which is obtained though placing of video cameras in strategic locations in and around your home.</p>

There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices.
