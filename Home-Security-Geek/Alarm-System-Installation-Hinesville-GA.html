If you are worried that your home can be robbed, it is a good idea to go for a combination intruder and fire monitoring service.

<p>Police and Government Security - Video Surveillance cameras are used every day to in crime investigation. Our home alarm systems are not only reliable when called on, but act as a great deterrent too.

<p>Fire protection systems are complex safety systems, which must be absolutely reliable in case of emergency. The fire alarm panel activates the flashers or the sounders, turns on sprinklers (or they can be activated along with the detector), or makes a call to the authorities or to the occupants. Intelligent addressable smoke detectors are compatible with MAXLOGIC series addressable panels. A Day and night cameras over and over again have changes in their digital signal processor that pays for the alteration in illumination between day and night methods.</p>
