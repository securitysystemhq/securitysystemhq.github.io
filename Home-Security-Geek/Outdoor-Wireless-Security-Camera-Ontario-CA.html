Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
