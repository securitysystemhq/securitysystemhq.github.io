Conspicuously placed cameras have been proven to reduce threats of violence and vandalism at businesses dramatically. It uses Z-Wave enabled devices to make it easy for you to automate lights, locks, thermostats, and more—no matter which level of monitoring you select. The first signal sent by your control panel will alert monitoring personnel at the central station, who will call to notify you and confirm whether it's a real emergency or a false trigger.</p>
