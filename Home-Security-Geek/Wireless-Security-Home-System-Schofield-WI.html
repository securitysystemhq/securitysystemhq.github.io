<p>A VIP system consists of a video camera (a digitiser in the case of analogue cameras) and a microprocessor for processing the digital-image - and software to interpret the image content and extract detection information from it.

CCTV systems can also use internet protocol (IP) to send out images in digital form to specified networks. You can get the great deal of home security monitoring tips online for the complete security of your family and property. Features like local recording storage through USB or microSD, tight integration with all the major smart home brands, and voice control through Alexa and Google Assistant make it our pick for overall best when it comes to a security system you can install yourself.</p>
