<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site.

<p>Smart-home integration: Most outdoor cameras offer some type of smart-home integration, such as support for Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, IFTTT (If This Then That), SmartThings, and more. Sometimes they are referred to as lipstick cameras. With over 400 cameras installed across the City, video surveillance has become another critical and valuable resource for public safety. When the photosensitive elements receive enough optical signals, the electrode distortion is generated to trigger the alarm signal 26 But its shortcomings are also very obvious: water mist from kitchen, cooking fumes, and even the haze in winter are likely to trigger the smoke sensor, resulting in frequent false positives.</p>
<p>This is the foundation of any interactive monitoring home security system. CCTV is also known as Video Surveillance system. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, creating ‘Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy. In the last few years, the video surveillance market has seen a major transformation into third generation video surveillance systems, moving to IP video from traditional analog video causing better processing power and improved compression algorithm 3 These Intelligent video surveillance systems are not just confined to laboratories but have hit the marketplace as well.</p>

The most basic systems are typically geared towards home security, alarm monitoring and basic lighting. If only a single tube is used, the alarm relay is placed in the plate circuit of the vacuum tube and the potentials are so adjusted that the plate current is high when the light is falling on the cell, and the grid voltage only slightly negative or even positive.</p>
<p>The video feed of the camera is then transmitted to a monitor or sets of monitors which you can easily view and record for surveillance purposes. For example, an interactive monitoring system can be programmed to send alerts when a motion detector is tripped. LifeShield's smart DIY security systems range in price from around $300 to $500, and you can get professional monitoring without a contract. VMS providers created new features like motion sensor technology that alerted guards when a person was caught on camera in a restricted area.</p>

If the door is kicked in or a window is broken, the sensors are tripped, an alarm rings and help is called.</p>

Video surveillance systems are a popular feature to add to your home security system. Some home security providers offer both DIY and professional installation, while others only provide one option.</p>
