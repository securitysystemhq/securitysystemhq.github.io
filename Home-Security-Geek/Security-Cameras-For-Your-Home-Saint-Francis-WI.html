<p>Surveillance cameras will catch the thief before, or during the process of committing the crime.

<p>The International Residential Code requires interconnected, hardwired smoke alarms in all new construction (Section R313) and the International Building Code and International Fire Code (Section 907.2) call for manual or automatic fire alarm systems in most commercial buildings with high life occupancy or other hazards. The best business security camera systems can act as a deterrent to potential thieves, but if the worst does happen and your business is broken into, you will have evidence that will help you claim on your insurance, and even hopefully get your stolen items back.</p>

Wireless alarm systems: These systems also don't require monitoring. Whether you're looking to install a CCTV camera outside a property to catch criminal activity, or have placed one inside to monitor the home or a company's goods, there's something for everyone.</p>
