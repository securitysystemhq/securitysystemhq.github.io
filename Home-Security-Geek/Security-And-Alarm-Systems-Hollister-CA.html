<p>It seems like the question of how a fire alarm system works passes through everyone's mind at some point or another. All of the systems in this article are installed by professionals, which are good for those who don't have the time, patience, or expertise to install all the requisite sensors and equipment. Indoor alarm systems will allow monitoring within the house. In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void.

Perhaps the best feature of the Nest equipment is the Nest Guard, a user friendly control panel that you use to arm and disarm your system and comes compatible with Google Assistant (Google is Nest's parent company).
