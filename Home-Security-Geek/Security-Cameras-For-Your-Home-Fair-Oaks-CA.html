<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>If a detector recognizes a condition which could be indicative of a fire, the control panel will first attempt a quick reset. Rather than initiating an alarm state, the control panel will go into a supervisory” state, if a sprinkler valve is in an off-normal” condition.

<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Wireless Security Cameras in Fair Oaks CA 95628</h3>

In the last few years, the video surveillance market has seen a major transformation into third generation video surveillance systems, moving to IP video from traditional analog video causing better processing power and improved compression algorithm 3 These Intelligent video surveillance systems are not just confined to laboratories but have hit the marketplace as well.</p>
