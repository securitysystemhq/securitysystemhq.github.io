Conversely, advanced digital cameras are those that are not connected by a circuit but can be located at any site around the world.

<p>We also prefer the outdoor capabilities of Nest systems, the solar panel and other wireless perks of the Arlo Pro 2, and the hard-to-hack DVR storage included with the Lorex LBV2531 system.
