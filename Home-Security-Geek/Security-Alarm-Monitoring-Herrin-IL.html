This section will describe the basic aspects of fire detection and alarm systems. By utilizing solid state storage on each camera, the MV family has removed the network video recorder (NVR) and its complexity from the equation.

Networks of cameras are installed by government agencies and by local businesses, but the distinction blurs with the development of real-time crime centers that access both public and private video feeds.</p>
<p>If you just want some standard alarm equipment and don't want to deal with contracts or paying for monthly monitoring, then Abode is a DIY dream. The resolution of your footage, amount of footage (how many cameras are recording), and length of time you want to store footage will dictate how much storage you will need.
