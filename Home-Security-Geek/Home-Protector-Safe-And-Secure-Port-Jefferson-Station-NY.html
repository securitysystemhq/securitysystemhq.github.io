<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness. An annual fee is charged for alarm monitoring, this is typically paid directly to the alarm company. All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios. A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>Security definitions can be adapted to each intruder alarm control system, for an individual security policy. Under this range, we comprises Burglar Alarm System and Intrusion Alarm System. With a CCTV camera, you loose image quality every time you transfer the video from the analog signal when it is digitized in the cameras Digital Signal Processor, which is then converted back to analog to run up the coax cable, which is again digitized at the DVR for recording.</p>

The system will come with an appropriate number of fire alarms which can be spread throughout the building.</p>
<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems. Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away. We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.</p>
