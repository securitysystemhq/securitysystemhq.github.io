<h3>Advantages of Using CCTV Camera Security System in Peoria IL 61604</h3>
<p>You can also find smart security cameras and lights to augment your home's security. Analog security systems - the recorded images or footage is sent to the DVR recorder (Digital Video Recorder) using a coaxial cable.

The ability to deter potential thieves, catch shoplifters, monitor cash registers, identify visitors, as well as increasing the security in and around your home and business area will reward you with a peace of mind. Here is a very basic explanation of how they work and what the major difference is between analog surveillance systems an IP camera systems.</p>
