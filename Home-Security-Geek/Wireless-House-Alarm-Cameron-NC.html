<p>Fire alarms vary in complexity and control. Analog system uses video cassette recorder (VCR) to store footage received from security camera. We are offering Burglar Alarm Panel to our client. Manage cameras and recordings with Digital Video Recorders that provide great compression technology and an easy-to-use user interface. Each intruder alarm system is one of the vertices (red marks) of the correspondent rectangle which is associated to one of the security areas.</p>

Many systems offer user-friendly features aimed at the elderly and people with disabilities, which makes learning a new routine easier.</p>
<p>Digital cameras: IP cameras are higher resolution, which generates clearer images but, as we said, use more bandwidth to transmit and require more storage space. As such, they provide added opportunity for emergency personnel to respond and control the developing fire before severe damage occurs.

<p>Landline, broadband, and cellular monitoring are different ways your home security system can be connected to the monitoring center. Digital video surveillance systems based on the principle of binary encoding of information that improves performance reading and writing data speed, improves quality of the signal transmitted by the camera and allows off-site internet viewing.
