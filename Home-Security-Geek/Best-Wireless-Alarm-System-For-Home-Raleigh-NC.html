Bullet security cameras are the most common CCTV camera type that you can normally see on the street, the supermarket, and the neighborhood. Another great feature is a backup battery installed in the home's alarm keypad to ensure the system will continue to function even if electrical power is lost.</p>

Being necessary to certain applications and environments to have a redundancy systems strategy, the topology of the distributed network ("grid") can implement this functionality with efficiency, because with all intruder alarm systems connected we can simply choose those for the same security and surveillance area.</p>
<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. In these systems, the monitor to be viewed will often be automatically shifted to a larger screen and will activate recording equipment.</p>
