Most cameras that do this are webcams, the expression "IP camera" or "netcam" is normally connected just to those used for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>One of the first decisions that you'll need to make is if you need a wireless or wired security camera system, and the correct answer likely depends on where you intend to place the cameras and components.

<p>If you really want to record the scene going on in the premises then you need to take the help of DVR (digital video recorder) systems. From this approach the "intelligence" capability of all the distributed net will be applied to react in a much more efficient way to the different alarm situations that can occur, being the alarm systems able to distinguish more accurately real security violations from, for example, unadvertedly operations, increasing security levels and also the immunity to technical failures.</p>
