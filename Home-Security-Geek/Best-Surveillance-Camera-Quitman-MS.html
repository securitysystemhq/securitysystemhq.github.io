<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>We offer comprehensive support for complete fire protection, testing and inspecting detection and alarm as well as sprinkler and hydrant systems. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with long and typically onerous contracts, and often rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little advantage. Meraki's pedigree in networking security means MV is built to be secure from the ground up. By default, data is encrypted through every step.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale are DIY-installed systems costing as little as £200. The monitoring company has guards watching the screens 24 hours a day just waiting to receive an alarm distress call. There's also a smartphone app and smart home compatibility built-in as well as optional monitoring from ADT and cellular backup. CP PLUS' extensive portfolio of products include state-of-the-art cameras, DVRs, that is simple to set up and use.</p>
