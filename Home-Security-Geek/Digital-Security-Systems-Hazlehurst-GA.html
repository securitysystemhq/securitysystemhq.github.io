The ability to deter potential thieves, catch shoplifters, monitor cash registers, identify visitors, as well as increasing the security in and around your home and business area will reward you with a peace of mind. Here is a very basic explanation of how they work and what the major difference is between analog surveillance systems an IP camera systems.</p>
<p>Sometimes also known as CCTV or Closed Circuit Television, video surveillance systems can allow you to track and monitor anything going on inside your home whether you're there or not.

However, the 24-hour service offered by monitoring may make you feel more secure, and the company will be liable if no action is taken in the event of a burglary.

We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
