<p>CCTV cameras also known as close circuit television have been a part of our lives since the year 1942 when they were first used by Siemens AG to observe the take-off of V2 rockets in Nazi Germany. They are small, portable, and can often be programmed so you can view surveillance footage via the internet, which means you can even check on your home while you're on vacation. It's also used by the control panel to monitor the state (alarm or no alarm) of the initiating devices and zone wiring. The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly—the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage).</p>
<p>We are looking at the global market for Smart Edge IP Cameras and Video Analytics such as facial recognition and various video metadata forensic search.

<p>The best home security systems use tools and technology to help keep you, your family, and your property safe. These systems consist of a central control panel to which smoke alarms and heat detectors are connected, along with bells or horns that are activated when the system triggers an alarm. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night.</p>

<p>The rapid growth in technology has remarkably enhanced the scope of remote health monitoring systems. IP video cameras are a great option for monitoring your home or business from a remote location.
