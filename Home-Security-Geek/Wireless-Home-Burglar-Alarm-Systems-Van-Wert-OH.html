<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>The burglar when shorts loop wires together hides the End-of-line-resistor from the control panel, letting the control panel know that something is going on.

There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>
<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>
<p>Apart from making a siren, the burglar systems are also used to lock the doors of the car and prevent the car from being used. In most cases, the installation process will begin with connecting the cameras either to their power source or to the network.

These are LED bulbs fitted on the camera, and switch on automatically in low light conditions and allow the camera to see in the dark in black and white images.</p>
