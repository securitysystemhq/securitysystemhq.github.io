<p>That competition has nudged third-party operators to step up their technology to the point where their technology and training can stack up against just about any in-house monitoring service. Manufacturers offer different types of cameras like fixed camera, bullet camera, dome camera, infrared camera, wireless security camera, spy camera and more.

<p>A closed-circuit television camera ( CCTV camera) can produce images or recordings for surveillance or other private purposes.
