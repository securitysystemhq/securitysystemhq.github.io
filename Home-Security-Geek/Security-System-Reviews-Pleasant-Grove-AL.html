<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>The best home security systems use tools and technology to help keep you, your family, and your property safe. These systems consist of a central control panel to which smoke alarms and heat detectors are connected, along with bells or horns that are activated when the system triggers an alarm. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night.</p>

You will also want all the basic security equipment as well, such as a control panel, window and door sensors, motion detectors, environmental protection sensors to protect your home from intruders or potential disasters such as a fire or pipe break, etc. The purpose of an automatic fire-alarm system is to detect an occurrence, alert the control panel and proper authorities, and notify the occupants to take action.</p>
<p>If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address. The CCTV cameras involve the components that are used for direct generation, storage and displays of important data. Video surveillance technology in the form of photo enforcement, for example, helps officials recognize traffic flow and congestion areas.

<p>The two devices strengthen an already compelling smart home security platform. Have your alarm system serviced regularly (at least once a year) and change the batteries in your sensors as soon as they start to get low, as this can be a common cause of alarm systems malfunctioning. No, we have security systems that use wireless, cellular technology. Digital CCTV cameras are generally equipped with an Internet Protocol (IP) Address.</p>
<p>Depending upon whether IP camera or analog video camera is used, the captured video can be transmitted over cables or through the air. The key advantage of smoke detectors is their ability to identify a fire while it is still in its incipient. You'll find security providers that offer smart home devices, and those who mainly offer integration, meaning that the security system will work well with devices from different manufacturers.</p>
