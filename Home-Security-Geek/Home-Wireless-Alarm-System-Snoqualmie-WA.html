In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, said optical system comprising a pair of lenses and a pair of prisms arranged to direct said light beams to a particular point, a photo-cell arranged to receive said light beams and convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photo-cell and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off.
