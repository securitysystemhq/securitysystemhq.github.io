In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, said optical system comprising a pair of lenses and a pair of prisms arranged to direct said light beams to a particular point, a photo-cell arranged to receive said light beams and convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said cell is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cell to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photo-cell and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>If your system has three false alarms (four in Scotland) in 12 months, you're struck off the police register, and they won't respond if the alarm goes off. Without the cable keeping lights, alarms, and sprinkler systems operating, tragedies are going to happen.
