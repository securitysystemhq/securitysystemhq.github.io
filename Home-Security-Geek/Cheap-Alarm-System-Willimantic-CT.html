<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>Not all companies support wireless alarm systems, but the best and most reputable companies support the technology. Even though prices are on the higher end, years of experience combined with the most monitoring centers in the land assure ADT customers get fast response times and helpful service when they need it most. Sufficient evidence has shown that CCTV surveillance systems mostly discourage crimes and robberies, but not more vicious crimes such as aggravated assault and rape.</p>
<p>The newest technology in camera surveillance is the use of computers to interpret the data. The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device.
