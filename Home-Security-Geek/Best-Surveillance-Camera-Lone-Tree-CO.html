<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make. The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>Apart from being an effective deterrent, surveillance cameras can also provide image evidence that can be aid in post-crime investigations and prosecution. After installation, we offer full training, maintenance, and support to keep your video surveillance systems operating effectively. You need to integrate your PC and the different home surveillance cameras into a single system that monitors and records the areas that you wish to keep an eye on. This may sound something like a GPS and is somewhat based on the same satellites.</p>

A fire alarm system has a number of devices working together to detect and warn people through visual and audio appliances when smoke , fire , carbon monoxide or other emergencies are present. Most of our surveillance systems include DVR viewer software for Mac and Windows PCs, as well as camera viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android mobile devices.</p>
<p>IP video cameras operate by providing a video feed through your high-speed Internet connection.

<p>Network video recorder (NVR) supports IP cameras only, however, to support analog cameras it requires an encoder.

<p>The most significant thing that these new IP cameras have in common is their accessibility. For example, you can create rules to have the lights turn on when motion is detected, have your doors unlock when a smoke alarm goes off, and have a camera begin recording when a sensor is triggered.
