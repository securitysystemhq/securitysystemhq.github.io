<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>However, while this is a general rule of thumb, it is not something that is set in stone so it is very important to make sure that you are investigating to find out just how much time the fire or smoke alarm really will last. This motion detection feature allows you to save hard drive recording space so you can record longer than the stated time above, and only record instances where something is actually happening in view, thus saving you a lot of time when you go back to view recorded video.</p>

<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
