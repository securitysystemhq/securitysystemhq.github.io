<p>Home security is big business both for security and alarm companies and of course the bad guys. In phase-I that is targeted for this year, South Western Railway (SWR) has recently commissioned Video Surveillance system (CCTV) at 6 major stations - Ballari by providing 33 Cameras, Belagavi with 36 Cameras, Vasco-Da Gama with 36 Cameras, Bengaluru Cantt with 21 Cameras, Bangarpet with 36 Cameras, Hassan with 36 Camera and at 3 Stations at Hassan, Shivamogga Town & Sathya Sai Prasanthi Nilayam, work is under progress and will be commissioned shortly.</p>

We deal in IP CCTV, CCTV Cameras installations, Biometric systems, Fire Detection Systems which are easy to operate, highly sensitive and offer high performance. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance.</p>

Some burglar alarms come with infra-red sensors, which activates an alarm when the sensor is crossed. Approximately 1 out of every 6 American families has an alarm system, and according to the National Burglar & Fire Alarm Association, the number of security-protected residences is rising.</p>
<p>With the advent of modern technology you now have smarter and affordable home security systems that you can set up all by yourself. If the building is also provided with an automatic sprinkler system, the water flow devices and valve tamper switches are also connected to the fire alarm system.

<p>And that includes security cameras: 1080p HD resolution, pan and zoom functions, and wide-angle lenses that give you a more complete picture. When it comes to home security systems, one of the benefits is the ability to watch the footage again later in the case of a break in.
