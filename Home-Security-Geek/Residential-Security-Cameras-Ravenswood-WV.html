<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>You may have to pay more for packages that come with smart home devices and capabilities. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is recorded when an alarm is triggered. Other systems using infrared technology detect motion in a room and set off an alarm. Stream live video and talk to anyone inside your home with our HD indoor security camera.</p>
<p>Detection devices run the gamut, from smoke detectors and heat detectors to multi-capability detectors, which contain a number of functions in one detector. Most companies also offer yard signs and window decals to warn potential burglars that a house is protected by an alarm service. Alternatively, your building's security system could consist of nothing more than a couple bubble cameras that only monitor hallways and office entries.</p>

Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. In rural applications, where reliable sprinkler water supplies can be expensive, mist systems may be comparable or less than standard sprinklers.</p>

Cameras with two-way communication have a mic that picks up sound near the camera, plus a speaker that lets you interact with people or pets on the other end. The installation is usually a one time fee, after that you will be paying a monthly fee for monitoring. Installing alarm system also becomes confusing sometimes.</p>
<p>You can opt for wired burglar alarm systems or can choose to have battery operated models for installation. Although, this is not an easy task, the experiments in this chapter show that, contrary to traditional detectors, video processing techniques can not only improve and accelerate the detection but also provide the analysis and the forecast of the fire.
