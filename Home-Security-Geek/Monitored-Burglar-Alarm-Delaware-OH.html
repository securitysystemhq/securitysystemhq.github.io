<p>With home security monitoring systems, you can have trained professionals monitor your home 24 hours a day, seven days a week from interconnected command centers. In an open-circuit system, the circuit completes when the alarm is triggered. It can include observing from assistance through an electronic device like CCTV cameras (Closed-circuit television) or by keeping a track on electronically transmitted information like on phone calls & internet traffic.</p>
<p>The system can be armed or disarmed using wireless remote control that can also be used as panic switch to alert neighbors in case of medical emergency or physical attacks or robberies. If power goes out, or the internet or cellular uplink goes down, the best security systems are designed to stay connected to the monitoring center (or send out an alarm) if the connection is disrupted. Here are the two common types of security alarms.</p>
<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>
<p>Wireless security cameras allow you to place cameras in areas that are not accessible to wired systems and allow you to be more covert in your camera placement. Finally there are Monitored systems , which means signals from the alarm system are sent to a special call centre and then acted upon by external means. Heat detectors usually have built-in thermistors to sense the heat. Whether you want to keep track of when your kids are getting home from school, you need to check on a sleeping baby, or you want to be able to visualize your home while you're away, video surveillance systems can allow you to get a peek inside any room of your home without your needing to be there.</p>
