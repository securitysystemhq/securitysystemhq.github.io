<p>I recently heard of a new home security company in New Mexico that is hiring ex police officers only to respond to alarm calls from members because quite frankly the response time from the police department was way to slow.

Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control panel and run through a landline. But since DIY equipment is purchased upfront, most DIY home security providers don't require a lengthy contract for leasing equipment.</p>

A substantial amount of time can be saved during investigation and prosecution by using evidence from security camera footage.</p>
