<p>A stronger and more effective mechanism in the form of security cameras is to be used. 4G LTE security camera , also called cellular camera , runs on 4G data with a built-in SIM card instead of the router network to work. Operators often wish to see a sequence of images from successive CCTV cameras, in the form of a video tour” (See Traffic Control ).
