All the control goes through your security DVR, so there is a time stamped recording being stored. The security burglar alarm project is designed toinform the concerned authorities about an unauthorized access to secure areas like museums, residential houses, show rooms and banks.</p>

Whenever anyone plans to purchase or install a video surveillance camera system, it is important to make decisions based upon location and purpose of the cameras.

Alarm monitoring is quick and detailed communication between your home security system and the central station of your security provider.
