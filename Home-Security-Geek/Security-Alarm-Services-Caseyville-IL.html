<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Many residents and businesses are now utilizing surveillance cameras and these cameras may capture persons and events without the owner's knowledge and this captured information may help the police department solve crimes and help keep the Borough safe. The Smonet outdoor security camera is equipped with night vision, wide-angle lens and 720p HD video quality. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small.</p>
<p>Apart from being an effective deterrent, surveillance cameras can also provide image evidence that can be aid in post-crime investigations and prosecution. After installation, we offer full training, maintenance, and support to keep your video surveillance systems operating effectively. You need to integrate your PC and the different home surveillance cameras into a single system that monitors and records the areas that you wish to keep an eye on. This may sound something like a GPS and is somewhat based on the same satellites.</p>
