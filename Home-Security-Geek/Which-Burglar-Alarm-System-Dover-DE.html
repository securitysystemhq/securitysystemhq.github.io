<p>Practically all buildings and a lot of homes these days have fire alarm systems. You need to purchase a base station in addition to the camera, which makes the up-front cost more hefty than other cameras. Devices that come with the SimpliSafe system include the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensor and HD video quality, and a keychain remote used to arm or disarm the system. Your alarm-monitoring company may offer discounts. Video surveillance has become an integral part of businesses and law enforcement agencies that use these cameras extensively.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>

All they need is access to the IP camera's network via the Internet. If your alarm is set and your home security is breached your alarm system will automatically and immediately send a distress signal to the monitoring company.</p>
