Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
