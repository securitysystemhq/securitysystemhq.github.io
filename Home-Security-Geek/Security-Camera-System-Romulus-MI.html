<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe promoted the use of CCTV , saying that cameras should be installed by homeowners and businesses to help detectives solve crimes. If your CCTV security cameras at home are positioned in all possible entries a thief might use, the likelihood of recording their movements, their physical build, and even their faces are high but seizing them on the spot before they can cry uncle is not always successful.</p>
<p>Statistically, approximately 61% of all sprinkler controlled fires are stopped by two or less sprinklers. This is the safest and simplest intention of a security alarm system. While there are many benefits of a traditional home alarm system that is installed by an experienced security professional, there are several do-it-yourself (DIY) systems on the marke t, and they are easier to install and more affordable than you think.</p>
