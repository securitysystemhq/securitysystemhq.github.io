One of the real benefits of wireless internet CCTV cameras is their capability to communicate intelligently across the internet.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
<p>Once the motion activation has been triggered, the camera begins recording everything in its field of view. One fundamental thing is that the system must be effortlessly expandable to guarantee that as and when required you can cover more indoor and outdoor regions with cameras.

Choosing the right security system for your property and budget is no easy task - there's a broad range of systems available and you are entering into a world filled with technical jargon.
