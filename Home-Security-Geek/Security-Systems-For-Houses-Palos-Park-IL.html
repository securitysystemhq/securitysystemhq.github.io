<p>This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit. Request that your alarm company contacts two phone numbers on the contact list prior to calling the police. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.
