<p>Ionisation alarms are best suited for detecting fast-flaming fires that don't give off much visible smoke. For instance, you can draw areas of active motion sensitivity within the camera's field of view to limit the number of alerts that arrive on your phone, and some of these cameras have object recognition and can tell the difference between a person and an animal, or a car. If you have the extra bandwidth on your network, the higher quality video and easier setup of NVR is likely the best choice.</p>
<p>The basic technology used in these cameras is CCD (Charge Coupled Device) which converts the captured images into electronic impulses.
