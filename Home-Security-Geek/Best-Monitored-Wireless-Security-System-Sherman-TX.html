<p>While outdoor cameras are really useful devices, have you ever wondered how they work? Provide cellular connectivity and management support, making them ideal for use in remote patient monitoring, clinical trials or for health visitors and social workers. For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, causing more than 100 of the cameras to go dark. Panic alarms receive police response based on fear of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms generally receive fire response based on an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
<p>If the intruder opens the door, the circuit breaks and triggers the alarm.

<p>In short, NVR records higher-quality video and allows for systems to be scaled up much more easily than can be done with DVR. Link Interactive offers a wide variety of panels, sensors, remotes, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, cameras, smart home hubs and smart locks, thermostats and lights - everything you need for intrusion detection, surveillance, environmental monitoring and home automation with the freedom to build your own system from the ground up.</p>
