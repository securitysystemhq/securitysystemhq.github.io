<p>Having a CCTV camera installed in your residential and commercial areas is not a new thing. Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them — from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe promoted the use of CCTV , saying that cameras should be installed by homeowners and businesses to help detectives solve crimes. If your CCTV security cameras at home are positioned in all possible entries a thief might use, the likelihood of recording their movements, their physical build, and even their faces are high but seizing them on the spot before they can cry uncle is not always successful.</p>
