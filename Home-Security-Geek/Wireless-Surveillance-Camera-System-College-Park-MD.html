<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>

Users can opt for either for a monthly subscription which includes camera and cloud storage for last 24 hours of video or can pay a one-time amount to get the camera and video storage for the last 4 hours.</p>
<p>Don't DIY your smart home security system - the pros at Vivint are totally worth the cost. On the other hand, security cameras require a more detailed view, as the footage is seen later and is needed to present evidence in the court. If an alarm-monitoring company decides to pass along the cost of the individual alarm fee to subscribers, each subscriber must be provided a copy of its policies and practices with respect to the billing of this fee, including information about any administrative charges added to the license fees.</p>
