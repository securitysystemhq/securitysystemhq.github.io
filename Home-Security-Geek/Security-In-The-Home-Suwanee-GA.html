<p>Surveillance cameras on the corner of a building. 5. In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two protective light beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses and shaped to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photoelectric means and means responsive to the varying voltage for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular uses for hidden surveillance cameras are to guard one's home or personal belongings. Depending on the type of burglar alarm installed there can be several deterrents to an intruder. India's 1st ever CCTV Live Monitoring service provider, which revolutionized the concept of security.

<p>With the wireless burglar alarm system, you do not need a trained electrician to install it for you. A common misconception about our camera systems is that all cameras have to be the same resolution, which is not the case. At the same time a small CCTV camera is watching to capture and transmit back the details of your pin code number. The main purpose of the this fire safety equipment is to make the fire known so that people can immediately evacuate the location while those who are entrusted as fire wardens can carry out the necessary emergency procedures.</p>
<p>The high maintenance cost associated with CCTV cameras coupled with high initial investment is expected to restrain the growth of overall CCTV cameras market during the forecast period.
