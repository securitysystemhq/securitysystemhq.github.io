<p>Dome Cameras: Dome Security Cameras are named for their dome like cameras are commonly used in surveillance systems inside of homes, casinos, retail stores, and restaurants. A fire alarm system has a number of devices working together to detect and warn people through visual and audio appliances when smoke , fire , carbon monoxide or other emergencies are present. Most of our surveillance systems include DVR viewer software for Mac and Windows PCs, as well as camera viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android mobile devices.</p>
<p>Multiple Users viewing: Multiple users could watch the live video from the same camera at the same time, clearly and smoothly. Most of the video surveillance systems installed in the US are for home and business security applications.
