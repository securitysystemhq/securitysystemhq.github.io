<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
<p>In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm. Most modern home security systems do not require a landline and rely off of cellular and wireless connectivity.
