<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks.

This service is often a paid subscription on top of the price of the camera itself, though some cameras offer free cloud storage to varying degrees. The basic plan provides users with three wireless door sensors and one wireless motion sensor. Optex aims at providing products and services to our customers in the fields of security detectors, access control, and industrial equipment, as well as transportation-related and LED lighting control systems.</p>

Loss Prevention - CCTV cameras can help keep personal belongings, merchandise and money where it belongs. There are essentially two types of security lighting you can fit to your house. For instance, a single home security device that sends push notifications to your smartphone about your IP camera's footage and the status of your smoke and motion sensors is more convenient than discrete systems that communicate separately with video cameras and emergency sensors.</p>
