<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>

The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm. In one, New York City police in a helicopter supposedly monitoring the crowds at the 2004 Republican Convention trained an infrared video camera on an amorous couple enjoying the nighttime "privacy" of their rooftop balcony.</p>

Again, when using video surveillance systems, the idea may be to let people know that they are being watched in order to keep them in line. With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone.</p>
<p>If an incompatible IP camera is used with an NVR, such changes will not be communicated to the IP camera, and changes will not apply before video is encoded by the camera. There are a few other questions you might want to consider before you select your burglar alarm system.
