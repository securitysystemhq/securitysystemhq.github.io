<p>A fire alarm is a fire safety device that is utilised to alert the public about a fire outbreak. When comparing video at the same angle of view (zoom length), higher resolution video provides facial detail farther away when using digital zoom for magnification. A passkey has also been assigned for secured data acquisition from sensors to the listening port of the smartphone. Nest Secure makes our list of best home alarm systems partially due to all the neat gadgets that come along with it. While it's definitely not the least expensive of the DIY installation home security options, at $399 there's a reason why the starter kit is listed at that price.</p>

The following regulatory documents apply to the fire alarm system as opposed to individual smoke alarms of the residential type, even when they are AC powered and used for group operation.
