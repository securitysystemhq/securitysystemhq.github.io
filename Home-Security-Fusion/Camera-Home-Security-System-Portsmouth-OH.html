However, generally most alarm systems work similarly. There have long been well-established rules governing the audio recording of individuals without their consent (there is a reason surveillance cameras never have microphones).</p>

From wireless to hybrid control panels, there is just the right type of alarm system waiting for you. With a wired system, all your sensors are physically connected to the alarm panel via wiring.
