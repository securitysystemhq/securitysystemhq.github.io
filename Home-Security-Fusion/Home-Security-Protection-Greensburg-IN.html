<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Stream your home cameras through your phone, arm your alarm system, and control all of your home devices from the same app. Abode also offers a Smart Security Kit that includes only one entry sensor and one motion detector.

This can save you money and give you the satisfaction of upgrading your home's security with your own two hands.</p>

The last thing that we're going to look at it is wireless security cameras. Cameras can also act as hub for other home devices by jumping onto the same wifi network.

<h4>Security Home Alarm System Greensburg 47240</h4>
