<p>It is believed that in the next five years the use of these cameras will escalate by 10 times in UK. Some places in UK have installed talking CCTV, where the operator can talk to the people they monitor. To avoid false triggering by sunlight, the photo transistor sensor is placed in the circuit such that it doesn't directly face sunlight. A system that covers a variety of safety and security needs, such as: fire detection, public address and voice alarm, access control systems, Close Circuit Television, care communications, electronic article surveillance, building management systems and alarm monitoring, security systems service and maintenance is the best to use at these times.</p>
<p>Each system (working as an individual node) has its own control, but also has the ability to monitor the state of the other alarm systems on the complete network. These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. A high-quality home security camera system is one of the easiest ways to deter criminals from breaking into a home.

They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
