<p>That competition has nudged third-party operators to step up their technology to the point where their technology and training can stack up against just about any in-house monitoring service. Manufacturers offer different types of cameras like fixed camera, bullet camera, dome camera, infrared camera, wireless security camera, spy camera and more.

<p>In broad terms, advanced video-based surveillance could be described as an intelligent video processing technique designed to assist security personnel's by providing reliable real-time alerts and to support efficient video analysis for forensic investigations. The Zmodo wireless security camera system is IP65-certified weatherproof and 720p HD night vision within 65 feet. In this chapter an introduction to most of the current video technology and equipment has been described.</p>
<p>Ionisation alarms are best suited for detecting fast-flaming fires that don't give off much visible smoke. For instance, you can draw areas of active motion sensitivity within the camera's field of view to limit the number of alerts that arrive on your phone, and some of these cameras have object recognition and can tell the difference between a person and an animal, or a car. If you have the extra bandwidth on your network, the higher quality video and easier setup of NVR is likely the best choice.</p>

Simply unpack the starter kit, read the instructions, plug in your control panel and place the sensors wherever you want the area to be covered.</p>
<p>Any potential intruders will see that you have an alarm system in place and are likely to move on to a more vulnerable property than yours.
