<p>A VIP system consists of a video camera (a digitiser in the case of analogue cameras) and a microprocessor for processing the digital-image - and software to interpret the image content and extract detection information from it. You may have noticed that the use of security systems, surveillance cameras, security guards and even 'under-cover' security personnel has increased dramatically in malls and even small mom-and-pop and convenience stores.</p>
<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to larger areas and allow the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. A network IP camera is smart, as it offers alarm management, image enhancement, license plate and facial recognition, and is built with the latest technology, and is really a little computer with a camera lens.</p>

The camera transmits a signal to the receiving unit that can store the video signal in a proprietary DVR unit or in some cases directly onto a computer hard drive.

When there is visual evidence through IP cameras, these claims can be proved either way. Whether you're interested in a camera to deter thieves or a way to make sure packages don't walk off the porch , there are a number of cameras designed to meet your outdoor security needs. Additional work for detection and special control equipment is avoided, which again saves time and expense.</p>
