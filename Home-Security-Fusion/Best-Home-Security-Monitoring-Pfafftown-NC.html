<p>One of the most important decisions you will have to make for your office is what type of fire alarm system you choose to have installed. I dont see how these CCTV cameras will stop terrorism. Surveillance camera, you can say it is one of the important tool to stop terrorism now, it keeps an eagle eye on criminal activities, but where ever you want to use such camera you should check it's recording quality first. Cabling between control panels may be standard structured cable, such as twisted pair or fiber optic, allowing the parts of the fire alarm system to use the same structured cable infrastructure that is used by other smart building systems.</p>
