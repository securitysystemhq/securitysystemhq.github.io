Vivint offers all of today's must-have home security features (professional monitoring, top-of-the-line equipment, home automation, mobile app access) with the added benefit of extensive smart home options and flexibility with your equipment and payment plan.

For most cameras, all you need to do is follow instructions on an app to connect them to your home network.</p>
<p>Vivint wireless security camera systems can be outfitted with motion sensor technology that is both energy-efficient and more secure. Presently, sophisticated burglar alarm ranging from miniature, self-contained noisemakers, to intricate, multi-zoned systems having color-coded computer monitor outputs are available.

A burglar alarm system consists of a series of electrical components that are connected to a property.</p>
<p>Fire alarms shorten your recovery time: Less building damage means shorter downtime until you can reopen for business. Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. In some cases, people will mount signs in their front yards alerting potential intruders that surveillance cameras are in operation.

In most cases, the installation process will begin with connecting the cameras either to their power source or to the network. The most common alarm systems use the principle of circuits: closed and open. These are LED bulbs fitted on the camera, and switch on automatically in low light conditions and allow the camera to see in the dark in black and white images.</p>
