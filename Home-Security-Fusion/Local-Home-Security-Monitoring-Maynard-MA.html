<p>Most office buildings, school, hospitals and homes today have fire alarm systems installed. Once you've installed your system, simply connect the DVR to your internet router or modem and you can view your cameras anywhere in the world at no additional charge. A bespoke intruder alarm system, supplied and maintained by ClearView, will deter and detect potential intruders to your site. This type of alarms is best at detecting fires which are smoky and smouldering.

It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control. SimpliSafe cameras work as standalone devices. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction.
