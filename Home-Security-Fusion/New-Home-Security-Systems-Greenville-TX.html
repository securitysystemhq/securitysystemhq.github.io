<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras.

This is not, however, a straightforward question as there are many different types of burglar alarm system to consider.
