<p>Installing a CCTV camera can sometimes be difficult and sometimes be easy. A security alarm system does not really intend to help property owners or residents to catch thieves. Adding a security sign in the front window or on a door is also a good way to deter a burglar. Wi-Fi cameras are yet another segment of cameras which is proving its usability in home security.
