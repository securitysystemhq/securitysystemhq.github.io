<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away” or Stay” mode. Around 2016, a young Israeli woman was recording family videos every weekend, but as a student and parent, she didn't have time to watch them. A burglar alarm system is not the same thing as a complete home security system, though it may constitute a part of one. They keep track of the temperature, and when it rises above a preset level, they react and these detectors cannot detect so small fires immediately.</p>
