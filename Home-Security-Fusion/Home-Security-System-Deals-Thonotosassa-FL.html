Small cameras such as a video pen camera, mini camcorders, and hidden cameras record to a flash drive or SD card.

<p>Among the sales arguments advanced for the burglar alarm, one of the strongest was that maintenance costs for the system were extremely low. Retail establishments use video surveillance to monitor what customers do. For example, if a client claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, video surveillance records are used to determine whether she was in the store on the day in question, and if she did purchase the item.</p>
<p>You can also ramp up your security level with more sophisticated add-ons such as a closed-circuit camera system for full monitoring inside your home and out. As the crime rate is increasing day by day and burglars are becoming smarter by every passing day, the security system for commercial setups likebanks, shops and houses need to be fool proof.

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
