When combined with face recognition , surveillance camera networks raise additional privacy and civil rights concernsâ€”particularly because face recognition data is prone to error.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR.
