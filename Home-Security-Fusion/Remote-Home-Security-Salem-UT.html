<p>Fire protection systems are complex safety systems, which must be absolutely reliable in case of emergency. The fire alarm panel activates the flashers or the sounders, turns on sprinklers (or they can be activated along with the detector), or makes a call to the authorities or to the occupants.

If they have a large number of home security alarm monitoring centers, these can provide extra coverage. Most systems include a combined fire alarm system and monitor as well.
