Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>

Many people opt for professional monitoring for their surveillance system, but this isn't the only way that you can see what's going on in your home.</p>
