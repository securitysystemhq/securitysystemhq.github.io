Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Most DIY systems are easy to install and are sold as kits that you can configure to suit your specific needs. Pro Series Doorbells provide video intercom functionality, supporting communication with the master station and the indoor station. The mobile and IP communications have developed and completely changed the way we now use, monitor and control intruder security systems.
