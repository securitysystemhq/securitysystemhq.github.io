<p>These cameras are shaped like a Dome and are commonly used for surveillance systems inside homes, casinos, banks, etc. However, a thief destroying multiple cameras will alert home security companies before he or she can make it inside your home. Here's a tip: You might not even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP cam or IP webcam. Because DIY systems tend to take fewer pennies out of your piggy bank, DIY home security customers feel a greater value for what they get.</p>
<p>Some cameras may use default passwords - which you should always change - or be easy to hack. As you can guess, with alarm monitoring worth so much, many of the family run alarm companies cashed out long ago. Among the biggest decisions to make when deciding which home security company to choose is whether you want to install it yourself or have a professional do it. Some people love the idea that they can install the system themselves, while others are concerned about being able to do the installation correctly.</p>
