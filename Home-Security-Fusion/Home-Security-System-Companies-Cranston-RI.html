When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety.
