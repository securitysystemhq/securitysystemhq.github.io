Analog security systems - the recorded images or footage is sent to the DVR recorder (Digital Video Recorder) using a coaxial cable. Motion sensor systems are battery-operated with strategic alerts to signal the control panel when running low. The occasional false alarm is usually considered par for the course - after all, no one can legislate for a deer pressing their nose against your window - but recurrent false alarms are an annoyance.</p>
<p>In some cases, anyone could open a browser window and view a camera's live video stream and witness the plate captures in real time. Along an automobile assembly line, video surveillance cameras are also used to monitor the totally automated installation of the windshield and rear-window. State-of-the-art sensors detect movement indoors and outdoors, listen for the sound of breaking glass to guard against intruders, protect valuables and more.</p>

Mounted in places such as driveways, parking lots, parking garages, and car alarm stores, video surveillance cameras are valuable in protecting one's investment.
