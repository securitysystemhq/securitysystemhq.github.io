Instead of standing and making single key presses into an alarm panel remote keypad, a technician should be able to log into a web site with a web browser and fully program the system via a graphical user interface.</p>
<p>You can view live video, playback recorded video on the DVR or remotely, back up video to a flash drive, without ever affecting the recording process on the DVR. This type of system includes a control panel, as well as wired sensors and motion detectors.

Monitored home security systems cost between $20 and $60 per month.

Professional installation services may cost up to $250, although special offers that waive installation fees are common.
