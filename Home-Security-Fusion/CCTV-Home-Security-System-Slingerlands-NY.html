One of the real benefits of wireless internet CCTV cameras is their capability to communicate intelligently across the internet.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
<p>Network video recorder (NVR) supports IP cameras only, however, to support analog cameras it requires an encoder. There are also some alarms systems, which do not sound an alarm but instead send a notification to your phone as soon as your system is activated. If your smoke alarms go off when you cook, you need a photoelectric alarm.
