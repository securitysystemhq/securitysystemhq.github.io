Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services. Fire safety begins with fire detection, and fire detection means everything from components—sensors, initiating devices, annunciators, and control panels—to integrated systems.</p>
<p>Today's home security systems are effective and affordable. Installing number of cameras allows the security staff to watch both the customers and employees to prevent theft of shop supplies. Surveillance systems can be used to monitor your entryways and windows, and can also be monitored either by you on your smartphone or by a company if desired. Whether you're home or away, you can check your home security cameras with the ADT mobile app on your phone.</p>

A burglar alarm system is not the same thing as a complete home security system, though it may constitute a part of one. They keep track of the temperature, and when it rises above a preset level, they react and these detectors cannot detect so small fires immediately.</p>

There may also be advantages in protecting a window with a burglar alarm rather than a lock so that you can get out quickly in case of fire.</p>
<p>Prevent Shoplifting: Security cameras installed in shops, stores and malls deter the shoplifters. What's even better is that you no longer need a complicated setup of monitoring cameras, as most modern security systems are unobtrusive, easy to install and use, and even stylish.

<p>Fire Detectors: Installed on the ceiling of the room, a fire detector sends signals to the control panel in case of fire. Image resolution: Most outdoor cameras stream 1080p video. With latest surveillance equipment you can monitor protected premises as a single location or multiple locations at once.
