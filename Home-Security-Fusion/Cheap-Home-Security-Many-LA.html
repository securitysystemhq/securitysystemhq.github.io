<p>With the continual increase in theft, burglary and vandalism, crime is something everyone thinks about. Bottom Line: The Abode iota is an easy-to-install all-in-one security system loaded with features including a 1080p camera, a motion sensor, multiple wireless radios, a built-in siren, and support for many third-party devices and platforms. When alarms go on and lights go out, people start pushing and shoving in order to escape the building. Drains should be properly installed to remove all water from the sprinkler system, and prevent water from leakage onto protected spaces, when piping service is necessary.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>For example, if you have mobility issues, you will probably want as many home automation features as you can get your hands on. These will allow you to remotely access, monitor, and control your entire home security system and much of your home's equipment such as door locks, window blinds, small appliances, thermostat, garage door, and more. Having such features will enable you more flexibility with remote or voice controls and without having to physically handle these systems manually.</p>

<p>And if a component of a DIY system fails, the homeowner is responsible for repairing or replacing it. With a traditional system, the home security company will typically replace faulty equipment for free, or for a minimal charge.

We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
