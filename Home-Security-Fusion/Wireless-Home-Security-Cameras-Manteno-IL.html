<p>One might think that the function of a fire alarm is to provide you with important evidence about a fire existing, allowing you to change your policy accordingly and exit the building. This section will describe the basic aspects of fire detection and alarm systems. By utilizing solid state storage on each camera, the MV family has removed the network video recorder (NVR) and its complexity from the equation. Has revealed 30% of false burglar alarms are triggered by insects and one in 10 false alarms is set off by a pet. It also supports a huge list of camera manufacturers (including IP cameras) so you aren't locked into a specific camera vendor or limited to a specific type of video capture hardware.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>We are engaged in Supplying superior quality Fixed Bullet IR Cameras. All of the systems we've tested feature an app that lets you use your smartphone as your command center to arm and disarm the system, create rules, add and delete components, and receive push notifications when alarms are triggered. These cameras are designed to provide high definition, crystal clear images and at the same time withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

<p>From the simplest application, viewing data through the web-browser on your iPhone, Blackberry device or laptop, to more sophisticated uses, such as sending a text or e-mail message when an alarm occurs, or transmitting a data log file over the internet from a remote location to a central office. Battery and cellular backup: Battery backup is a premium feature on many security cameras. In IN-TIME, the use of a central monitoring unit in addition to frequent transmissions was instrumental in facilitating early treatment adjustments.</p>
