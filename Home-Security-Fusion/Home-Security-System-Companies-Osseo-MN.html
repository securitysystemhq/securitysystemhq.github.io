<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

<p>Surveillance plays a huge part in today's society, and with cameras all around us, our day-to-day lives are experiencing higher levels of security each day. Your job is not done, however, after you buy and install smoke detectors.

Dialler burglar alarms automatically dial your phone number, or that of nominated friends and family, when the alarm is triggered.</p>

Burglar alarm circuits are constructed in a similar manner, other than the fact that instead on flipping a switch, the alarm's circuits are completed when it detects an intrusion like a breaking of a window, or opening a door, when it is activated.</p>
