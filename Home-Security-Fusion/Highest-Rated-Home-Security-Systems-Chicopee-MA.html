<p>CCTV cameras are extensively used in organizations, institutions, shopping malls, banks, casinos, airports and homes and have become an indispensable security tool for scrutinizing people and activities. To better understand the mechanism by which daily RM reduced all-cause and CV mortality in IN-TIME, Hindricks et al. 44 recently performed an individual patient meta-analysis (Truecoin) of three Home Monitoring trials: TRUST, ECOST, and IN-TIME (Table 1 ). The composite CV endpoints combining CV- or all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization, and the composite WHF endpoints combining WHF- or all-cause mortality and WHF hospitalization were analysed.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
