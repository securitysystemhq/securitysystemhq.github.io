A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

<p>A company called Axis Communications invented the first internet-enabled surveillance camera , which converted moving images to digital data. Remote view your surveillance system on your iPhone, iPad or Android device. Sensors If you don't want a camera in every room you should install a motion detector (at least in the hallways) that can send alerts and set of an alarm.
