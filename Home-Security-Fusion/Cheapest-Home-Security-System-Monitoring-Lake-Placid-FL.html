<p>Experts believe that CCTV discourages opportunistic crime, where an offender spontaneously takes advantage of a situation. Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>
