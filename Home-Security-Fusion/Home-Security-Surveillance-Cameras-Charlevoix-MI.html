For microcontroller MC2 , keypad is connected to port 1 and LCD display is connected to port 2 and motor driver is connected to pins P1.2 and P1.3 and touch sensor is connected to pin P1.4. Motion detector is connected to pin P3.3 and taken as a input interrupt (INT1) to the microcontroller 2. The password request switch is connected to pin P3.2 and taken as a input interrupt (INT0) to the microcontroller.</p>
<p>You still get remote viewing capabilities on the Nest mobile app, but the system only stores clips (not continuous recording). The high cost associated with the installation and maintenance of home security systems is the key factor limiting the growth of this market.

A wireless burglar alarm system can be easily expanded to include additional motion sensors and other peripherals (smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, driveway and pool sensors, motion activated lights, etc.). A hard-wired system may be limited to the number of peripherals offered by a particular service.</p>

One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally. A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing.
