We deal in IP CCTV, CCTV Cameras installations, Biometric systems, Fire Detection Systems which are easy to operate, highly sensitive and offer high performance. Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance.</p>

Most businesses do not routinely test their fire alarms and of those that do, many do not properly test the systems.</p>
<p>It should be noted that when fire alarms systems are properly installed and maintained, they perform very well. Dome CCTV - Dome security cameras are named for their round dome-like shaped housing of the camera; they are capable of covering a larger area of surveillance.
