<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make. The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>
<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it. The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system. For a fairly modest outlay, this security camera delivers a reliable performance - provided you use the Ethernet cable, because Wi-Fi connectivity can be flaky - and a good set of features. These detectors are preset to sound an alarm when the air temperature exceeds the fixed temperature. Identify threatening events: Video analytics can also be used to identify threatening events to pro-actively identify any lapse in security incidents, be alert, and to stop them; for example, license plate recognition, perimeter violation, abandoned objects detection, and people counting.</p>

<p>Wireless alarms are also portable, so can be removed temporarily for decorating or permanently if you decide to move home. To protect visitors, employees and exhibits from fire, local Bosch partner Elektroprojekt installed the Modular Alarm Platform 5000 with 700 intrusion detectors securing administrative and office areas in addition to the storage of the museum's collection. Cloud recording: Many manufacturers offer cloud storage plans with their camera.</p>

<p>Fortified security cameras are designed to deliver the highest-quality video in the harshest environments and conditions. These modern smart fire alarm systems are more sensitive than classic models and are better at avoiding false alarms. Look for a camera that supports up-to-date wireless security protocols, such as WPA2, and make sure it encrypts internet transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds.</p>

After using models long-term for over a year, along with testing several new models, we still think the Logitech Circle 2 is the best indoor security camera.</p>
<p>Most wireless security cameras operate on the 2.4 Ghz frequency band and have a range between 300 and 600 feet depending on obstructions between the camera and receiving unit. HDCVI cameras also tend to be less expensive and are simpler to install and maintain in large scale surveillance systems. With these devices, you pop a magnet onto your door or window with the sensor and tiny alarm unit nearby. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras only from certain manufacturers and not others.</p>
