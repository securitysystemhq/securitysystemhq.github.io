<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

<h3>Factors to Consider When Buying a Home Security Camera in Chicago Heights</h3>
<p>These are the best indoor home security cameras in our testing. Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on gives you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away. The detection principle of an Addressable System is the same as a Conventional System except that each detector is given a set Address (usually by means of a dip-switch) and the Control Panel can then determine exactly which detector or call point has initiated the alarm.</p>
<p>In addition, the marriage of mass-notification systems (MNS) and fire-alarm control systems is a growing trend that will hopefully continue and be applied in larger varieties of facilities and multibuilding properties, including schools, high-rise buildings, mass-transit hubs, and even public gathering places such as theaters, restaurants, and places of worship. They also have a regular inspection schedule for checking out public buildings and their fire safety equipment.</p>
