<p>Initially, fire alarm systems are designed to detect any element associated with fires. Modern line detectors are very stable and false alarms caused by animal motion, rain, fog or snow have been eliminated. Conspicuously placed cameras have been proven to reduce threats of violence and vandalism at businesses dramatically.

<p>All these sensors work in tandem with other sensors and the IP camera so that the central control device sends warnings and notifications to your smartphones. The detectors observe the environment with superb reliability with a very small risk of triggering a false alarm.
