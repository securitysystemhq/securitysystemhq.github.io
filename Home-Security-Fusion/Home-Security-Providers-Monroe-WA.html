<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks.

Fire sprinklers utilize water by direct application onto flames and heat, which causes cooling of the combustion process and prevents ignition of adjacent combustibles. In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: The Arlo Ultra is the first outdoor security camera we've seen that streams and records video in stunning 4K. It's expensive, but it's packed with features including color night vision, motion tracking, auto zooming, and intelligent motion detection. From there, we narrowed down the list based on the best selection of features, price and reviews, and contacted each to get a quote for installation and services.</p>
