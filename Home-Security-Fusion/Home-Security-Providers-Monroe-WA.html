In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: The Arlo Ultra is the first outdoor security camera we've seen that streams and records video in stunning 4K. It's expensive, but it's packed with features including color night vision, motion tracking, auto zooming, and intelligent motion detection.
