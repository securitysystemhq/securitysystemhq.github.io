<p>CCTV security cameras have come a long way since being first introduced into the market in the late 1960's. We deal in a wide assortment of products including video surveillance systems, time attendance system, finger print based time attendance system, card based time and attendance system, biometric (finger print) door lock, CCTV camera system, IR camera, night vision camera, networking multi-doors controller, box camera, PTZ dome camera, dome camera, heat detectors, PIR sensor, long distance inductive guard tour system and guard tour system for non-security personnel.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>Statistically, approximately 61% of all sprinkler controlled fires are stopped by two or less sprinklers. This is the safest and simplest intention of a security alarm system.

Other types of cameras include dome cameras that can capture video images in a 360-degree angle, bullet cameras, day night cameras, infrared cameras that can capture images at night, vandal proof (unbreakable) cameras, and hidden cameras.</p>
<p>A wired camera has a video cable that transmits the video signal from the camera to a recording or viewing device. The detectors in a zone (or area) of the building are all connected to the same pair of wires. We didn't consider alarm systems that required professional installation. Integrated remote monitoring solutions with messaging and alert systems can let providers know when patients are in stable or critical conditions without the need for hospital room.</p>
