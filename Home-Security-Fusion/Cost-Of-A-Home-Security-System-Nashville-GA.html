Also, some security cameras can be used both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p>Homeowners can choose between a landline, broadband or cellular connected system, and the system is controlled through a base station rather than through a keypad on a control panel like most home security systems.

<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. The major selling point here however is its ability to not give false alarms - the camera has two sensors, one detecting movement, and one looking for changes in temperature (body heat) and it requires both sensors to trigger before the alarm will sound and you'll be alerted. Any security or life-safety device that is part of the setup will be integrated with the security system, providing the user with complete control over these devices.</p>

Systems that include video cameras like business security systems have an average monthly cost between $45 to $70 a month. An additional benefit for this type of connection is the fact that most monitoring companies using this technology routinely query your connection to make sure that it is active.</p>
