If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring and control (M&C) systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as factories, power plants, network operations centers, airports, and spacecraft, with some degree of automation. That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. Professionally installed systems take the trouble out of things for homeowners who don't have the time or expertise to set up all the sensors and accessories themselves.</p>
