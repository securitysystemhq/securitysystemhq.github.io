<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
