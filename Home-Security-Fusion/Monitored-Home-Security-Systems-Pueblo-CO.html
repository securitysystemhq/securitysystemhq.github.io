A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

To effectively guide people to safety in case of an emergency, fire alarm devices in public and commercial buildings must be carefully matched to local requirements. A typical example would be to have multiple buildings of a facility have their own panels, which could detect input signals from specific smoke detectors or other signaling device.</p>
<p>When a door or window is closed, the two parts of the sensor are joined together, creating a security circuit. Cameras with motion detection can send you notifications when the camera observes motion within its field of view. If you already own a Ring video doorbell and want to expand your home security coverage, adding Ring Alarm makes sense.
