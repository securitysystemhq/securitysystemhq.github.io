<p>CCTV Cameras come in a variety of shapes and sizes. I am so glad that you have mentioned about smart home integration Just last week I was given bunch of cameras to install by a home owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. We've seen so many companies upgrade their equipment or add in new smart home features that we had to take a totally new look at the alarm systems out there. Once inside, the circuit system is not effective anymore since it is not practical to set up circuits in every inch of the house.</p>
<p>Depending on the anticipated fire scenario, building and use type, number and type of occupants, and criticality of contents and mission, these systems can provide several main functions. Arm and disarm your home security system, view live video feeds, lock or unlock your doors, and even adjust your smart thermostat directly from your phone. ADT (US), Moni (US), Honeywell (US), Securitas (Sweden), UTC (US), Schneider (France), Johnson Controls (US), Vivint (US), Vector Security (US), and Bosch (Germany) are some of the major companies dominating the alarm monitoring market.</p>
