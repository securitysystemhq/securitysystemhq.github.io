<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>

<p>Ask the home security company for an itemized breakdown of all charges, which may include equipment costs, installation fees, monthly monitoring charges and more. The Digital Video Recorder also known as a DVR is used to take footage or video taken by a security camera and storing it as the name says, digitally, onto a hard drive.

<p>Web-based intruder alarm systems may include the use of distributed nets ("grids"), giving each node the ability to dynamically configure its functions within entire respect for the security scope issues. Some of these cameras even have digital video recorder capabilities to video the recordings at a later time. Passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors are used in the most advanced and also in some of the most simple security systems.</p>
<p>In addition, the equipment and installation costs may vary by company, so you can save by comparison shopping. Maintenance employees can use video surveillance cameras to detect equipment that needs repair and equipment that is operating in an unsafe manner. IP cameras are far more powerful than analog cameras, usually shooting footage of between 1 megapixel and 5 megapixels.

Simply unpack the starter kit, read the instructions, plug in your control panel and place the sensors wherever you want the area to be covered.</p>
<p>And the software also provides other functions, like wiper control, editing password, restoring default settings, and batch upgrading. Directly attached storage are the hard drives that are located outside of the digital video recorder, network video recorder or server. Some providers have motion sensors that are designed to be pet-friendly, avoiding pets under 80 pounds to help prevent false alarms. Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>
<p>Network cameras can be used for very cheap surveillance solutions (requiring one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV installations (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs , and CCTV monitors become computers with TFT screens and specialised software.
