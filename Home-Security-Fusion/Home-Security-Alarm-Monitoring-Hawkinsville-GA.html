<p>CCTV cameras are extensively used in organizations, institutions, shopping malls, banks, casinos, airports and homes and have become an indispensable security tool for scrutinizing people and activities. To better understand the mechanism by which daily RM reduced all-cause and CV mortality in IN-TIME, Hindricks et al. 44 recently performed an individual patient meta-analysis (Truecoin) of three Home Monitoring trials: TRUST, ECOST, and IN-TIME (Table 1 ). The composite CV endpoints combining CV- or all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization, and the composite WHF endpoints combining WHF- or all-cause mortality and WHF hospitalization were analysed.</p>

When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
