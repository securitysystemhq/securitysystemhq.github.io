<p>Is there any place in your plant which is not suitable for a person to stay there to monitor important process? There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>

Passive infrared (PIR) motion detectors are used in the most advanced and also in some of the most simple security systems.</p>
<p>When any of the security sensors are breached by an intruder, the control panel relays a message to the monitoring service or sets off your home-mounted alarm. However, you need to remind yourself that while there are outdoor cameras equipped with high tech functions and features, you only need to choose one that meets your needs, budget and lifestyle.
