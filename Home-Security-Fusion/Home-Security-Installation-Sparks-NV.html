Value Series DVRs offer a cost-effective and high quality video surveillance solution with H.265 Pro+ and H.265 Pro compression technology, up to 5 MP Ultra HD encoding ability and great durability. And Current Health is hardly alone in the space —for instance, Bardy Diagnostics just raised $35.5 million for its remote monitoring patches, while Spry Health's COPD wearable received clearance earlier this month.</p>
