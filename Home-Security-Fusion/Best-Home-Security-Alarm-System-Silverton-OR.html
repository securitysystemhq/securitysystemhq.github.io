In a protective alarm system, a light source, an optical system for dividing light from said source into a plurality of beams extending across an area to be protected comprising a pair of mirrors and a pair of lenses cooperating therewith, said mirrors deflecting said light to a point in space, a photo-cell for receiving said light, a light chopper for normally passing a constant quantity of light and passing a varying quantity of light when one beam is intercepted by an intruder in said area and signal means responsive to said varying light.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers.

Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>The cameras deter crime and may lead some students to confess to infractions that weren't even caught on the security cameras.
