Activation of a burglar alarm circuit is made when the switch detects the opening or closing of the circuit, for example opening a door or window.</p>

ADT offers pet-immune motion detectors, wireless components for easy integration into your home, and two-way voice capabilities. Cameras that are set on potential entry points that have DVR capabilities are a great way to help law enforcement personnel identify burglars and vandals.</p>
