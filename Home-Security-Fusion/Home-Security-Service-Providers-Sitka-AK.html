<p>The importance of a properly installed fire alarm system is not to be overlooked. Along with high resolution images, Matrix IP cameras decrease storage costs by offering latest H.265 Compression technology. Finally, experts state that a home without an alarm system is three times more likely to be burglarized than a home with a professionally monitored system installed. With the latest smart home technology from your favourite security brands, deterring burglars and detecting trespassers has never been easier.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>The ADT app makes controlling your home security simple and intuitive with our interface. Boasting 360-degree continuous pan range, and -5 to 90-degree or more tilt range, the speed dome series thermal cameras can automatically track targets in thermal and optical channels simultaneously when an alarm is triggered. There are new and advanced CCTV mega-pixel cameras available which can take 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution images of the camera scene either on a time lapse or motion detection basis.</p>

Some outdoor cameras can be controlled remotely, giving the homeowner the ability to pan or zoom the camera from their smartphone, for example.</p>
<p>It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered.
