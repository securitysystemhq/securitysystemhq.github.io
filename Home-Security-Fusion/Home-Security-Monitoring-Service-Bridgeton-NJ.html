<p>Installing a CCTV camera can sometimes be difficult and sometimes be easy. A security alarm system does not really intend to help property owners or residents to catch thieves. Adding a security sign in the front window or on a door is also a good way to deter a burglar. Wi-Fi cameras are yet another segment of cameras which is proving its usability in home security.

<p>This is a big problem for CCTV, where the cameras are often grainy and the angles are often weird. Aside from putting off the alarm to warn the people inside the building or home, it is also responsible for notifying fire brigades for efficient rescue operations. The security system will use a microcontroller known as Arduino Uno to interface between the components, a magnetic Reed sensor to monitor the status, a buzzer for sounding the alarm, and a WiFi module, ESP8266 to connect and communicate using the Internet.</p>
