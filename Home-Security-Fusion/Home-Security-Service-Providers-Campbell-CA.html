<p>Many cities, businesses, and individuals have installed Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras for surveillance purposes. The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control. SimpliSafe cameras work as standalone devices. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. Home monitoring sensors have a number of applications in your overall home security.</p>

<p>Frontpoint customers give the provider high ratings for service, especially throughout the product selection and DIY installation process. When you're setting up video surveillance, determine how many cameras you want to get and what type they should be.

<p>Home security systems that are 100% DIY let you pick the security products, set them up, and monitor themâ€”all on your own. The camera transmits a signal to the receiving unit that can store the video signal in a proprietary DVR unit or in some cases directly onto a computer hard drive. Dusty buildup can lead to false alarms or delayed detection during an emergency. Installing a particular security monitoring system can certainly help cause you less of a burglar's target.</p>
