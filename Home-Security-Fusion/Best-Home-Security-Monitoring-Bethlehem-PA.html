<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trod¬den on. Most d-i-y alarm systems have a manually operated panic button (or personal attack button) which is fitted by the bed or by the front door and will set oil' the alarm (even when the system is deactivated) if you push the button (it can be reset only with a key).</p>
<p>Vivint wireless security camera systems can be outfitted with motion sensor technology that is both energy-efficient and more secure. Presently, sophisticated burglar alarm ranging from miniature, self-contained noisemakers, to intricate, multi-zoned systems having color-coded computer monitor outputs are available.

<p>Although many video surveillance cameras appear to be similar to each other, providing the same specifications, they are not the same. A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Sharpens the edges of objects or people in the cameras view giving a more sharper image and detailed video. Most systems can be fitted with an internal alarm which goes oil' just before the main alarm sounds.</p>
<p>The word Surveillance has been derived from the French word sur” means from above” and veiller” means to watch.” Surveillance means to monitor behaviors, movements, activities, and information for controlling, managing, and protecting people. Our outdoor security cameras have a weather rating of IP66. Equipped with a back-illuminated sensor, these cameras provide exceptional low light performance, to the extent that they produce color images in light as low as 0.01 lux.</p>

<p>Professional monitoring - Many DIY home security providers don't offer professional monitoring to watch over your home at all times. The most popular fixed temperature detectors used in homes are preset to sound an alarm when the temperature exceeds 135 degrees F. Other units are available to be preset up to temperatures of approximately 200 to 225 degrees F. These detectors may be used in an attic where summer temperatures normally may reach 135 degrees F.</p>
