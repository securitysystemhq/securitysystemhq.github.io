Using a 4MP security camera mounted 7ft above the object of interest, we show the power of optical zoom provided by a motorized zoom security camera to view objects in fine detail.

<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR.
