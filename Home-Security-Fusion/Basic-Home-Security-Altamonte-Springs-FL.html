<p>CCTV Cameras come in a variety of shapes and sizes. I am so glad that you have mentioned about smart home integration Just last week I was given bunch of cameras to install by a home owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. We've seen so many companies upgrade their equipment or add in new smart home features that we had to take a totally new look at the alarm systems out there. Once inside, the circuit system is not effective anymore since it is not practical to set up circuits in every inch of the house.</p>

The high cost associated with the installation and maintenance of home security systems is the key factor limiting the growth of this market. Gone are the days when only business owners relied on monitoring systems to protect their property. A wireless burglar alarm system can be easily expanded to include additional motion sensors and other peripherals (smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, driveway and pool sensors, motion activated lights, etc.). A hard-wired system may be limited to the number of peripherals offered by a particular service.</p>
