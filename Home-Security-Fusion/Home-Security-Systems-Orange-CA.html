In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting a beam across said opening, an optical system arranged to divide the light from said source into two beams, means for receiving said light beams and converting said beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, a light chopper arranged so that the output of said receiving means is constant and to vary the voltage of said energy when one of said beams is intercepted by an intruder and means responsive to the varying volt- 85 age for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>When combined with home security, home automation can help increase your home's energy efficiency, remotely control your alarm system, and let you check in on kids or pets when you're away from home. The systems have adjustable electronics to permit installers to change the sensitivity of the alarm detectors to the suit specific environmental conditions. Horns are another option, and are especially well suited to areas where a loud signal is needed such as library stacks, and architecturally sensitive buildings where devices need partial concealment.</p>

These cameras are designed to provide high definition, crystal clear images and at the same time withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

Having your alarm system professionally maintained can help tackle any problems with false alarms.

<p>Service Providers can give their customer, the homeowner, the power to monitor and control many devices in the home: Thermostats, door locks, lighting, cameras - while at home or away.
