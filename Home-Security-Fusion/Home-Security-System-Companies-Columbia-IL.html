<p>When it comes to a closed-circuit, no energy means alarms sound immediately. This uses the latest innovations in video compression technology to provide high resolution video quality from the smallest amount of video data required. Fire alarm systems typically consist of several inter-linked components, such as smoke detectors, heat detector, carbon monoxide, manual call points, sounders, alarm and buzzer. Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>The fire alarm panel (or the fire alarm control panel - FACP) is the base or the control hub of the system. For a fairly modest outlay, this security camera delivers a reliable performance - provided you use the Ethernet cable, because Wi-Fi connectivity can be flaky - and a good set of features.
