<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Sprinkler systems can be designed and installed with almost no aesthetic impact. In the succeeding years, extra surveillance cameras may be added as the budget allows. Install individual security cameras or build a full home security system with multiple video cameras based on your security needs. The alarm systems can be concealed in the car or a vehicle which comes to life when it is tampered by some one and thus alerts the car owner from taking an immediate action.</p>

Like a lot of other standard IP cameras, Smart iCam provide visual motion detection feature. IP cameras also have additional features that analog cameras don't offer, such as video analytics, which allow for mobile notifications and automatic recording if there is movement within the camera's field of vision.</p>

Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate appropriate responses.</p>
