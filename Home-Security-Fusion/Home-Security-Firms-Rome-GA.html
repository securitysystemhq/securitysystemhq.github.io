<p>CCTV cameras also known as close circuit television have been a part of our lives since the year 1942 when they were first used by Siemens AG to observe the take-off of V2 rockets in Nazi Germany. They are small, portable, and can often be programmed so you can view surveillance footage via the internet, which means you can even check on your home while you're on vacation. It's also used by the control panel to monitor the state (alarm or no alarm) of the initiating devices and zone wiring. The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly—the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage).</p>
<p>Many residents and businesses are now utilizing surveillance cameras and these cameras may capture persons and events without the owner's knowledge and this captured information may help the police department solve crimes and help keep the Borough safe. The Smonet outdoor security camera is equipped with night vision, wide-angle lens and 720p HD video quality. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small.</p>
