They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it. With this problem in mind, most deaf people have security systems with sensors. Because of this arrangement, these systems are actually monitoring and controlling circuits, and not individual devices.</p>
<p>All countries with a population of at least 250,000 are using some form of AI surveillance systems to monitor their citizens, says Steven Feldstein from the US think tank Carnegie And it is China that dominates this market - accounting for 45% of the sector's global revenue. Modern healthcare systems are undergoing a paradigm shift from in-hospital care to in-home monitoring, leveraging the emerging technologies in the area of bio-sensing, wireless communication, mobile computing, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Recently, people have used smoke alarms which only have one sensor to detect fire. In February, Edinburgh, Scotland-based Current Health (formerly snap40) received FDA clearance for clinical use of its artificial intelligence-enabled device and platform for remote patient monitoring in the hospital.
