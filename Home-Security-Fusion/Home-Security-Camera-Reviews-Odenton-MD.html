<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>When it comes to a closed-circuit, no energy means alarms sound immediately. This uses the latest innovations in video compression technology to provide high resolution video quality from the smallest amount of video data required. Fire alarm systems typically consist of several inter-linked components, such as smoke detectors, heat detector, carbon monoxide, manual call points, sounders, alarm and buzzer. Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>
