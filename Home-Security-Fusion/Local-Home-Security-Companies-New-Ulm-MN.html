<p>Indoor cameras are designed to sit inside and monitor an area. Several security systems offer integrations with popular voice activation hubs like Amazon Alexa, but experts predict companies that are moving toward voice controls will become obsolete. That means you can add, for example, a smart speaker to arm, disarm, and check system status with the sound of your voice, as well as trigger cameras or lights to go on based on alerts or your location.</p>
<p>STANLEY is proud to offer the experience and expertise to design, install, service, and monitor a system that will fit your unique business needs, as well as integrate with your existing systems. That is why false alarms are usually fined by the government.
