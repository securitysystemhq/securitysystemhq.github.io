<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>Detroit has popularized plug-in surveillance networks through its controversial Project Green Light program. Professional monitoring gives you peace of mind during an alarm, no matter where you are. Add sensors using your phone's camera by scanning the QR code present behind the sensor. An individual (not a business or organization), may record a conversation as long as one of the participants has consented to the recording.</p>
<p>We even ensure to provide after sales services for these high definition household CCTV cameras. This monitoring equipment alerts the operator when the monitor must be viewed. Not only that but if your monitored security system is linked through to the police then three false strikes can mean you'll be struck off their register and they won't attend any future alerts. Not only can surveillance cameras deter criminals and help law enforcement quickly catch any would-be thieves, but these systems can also improve the accountability of your employees, help you monitor productivity and sometimes even reduce your insurance premiums.</p>

This can be used for safety purposes, that is, a sensor may detect when a car (even your own car) pulls into the driveway and exterior lights are activated.
