The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>

Appointing security guards is a traditional practice, but with developing technology, a number of surveillance aids are made available. The selected sprinkler components should be provided by a reputable manufacturer, experienced in special, water sensitive hazards. Look for flexibility in scaling of sizes and features - our vast customer base includes some of the most security-conscious organizations and locations around the world who demand open, standards-based solution for any edge device: analog, IP, or megapixel, which allows for the continued use of the cameras already in place, in addition to new cameras.</p>

Pick between a full spectrum of intrusion protection, activity detection and environmental monitoring devices. The electronics of the detectors analyzes both signals and triggers an alarm only in the case of simultaneous detection of an intruder.</p>
