<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>One of the most popular and cost effective ways of providing security in the home and place of work is with cctv cameras and equipment.

Another object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric detection system which is selfcompensating in that changes of ambient light, such as daylight or artificial illumination, will not cause the system to give an alarm and which cannot be defeated by using a flash-light or some other form of light source. The San Diego Police Department hoped to gain access to footage from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego” surveillance program As of 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility problems, and officers had difficulty viewing footage in real time because the department's police cruisers did not have a 4G connection.</p>
