There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>

Designed for unique purposes and scenarios, Hikvision's Special Series is integral to reliable network video solutions that require more than standard network cameras can offer. If you choose not to add another monthly fee to the mix, you may be disappointed with what the Nest Cam Outdoor can (and can't) do. It still delivers live video and alerts you when it detects sound or motion, but it stores those alerts for only up to three hoursâ€”and it gives just a snapshot of the action that triggered them.</p>
