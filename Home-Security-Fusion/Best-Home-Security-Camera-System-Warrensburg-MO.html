<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly detect motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.

There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>

<p>Security cameras can often integrate with a smart home hub like Amazon Echo or Google Home. If you have caps on your internet data usage, make sure you understand how your security camera(s) could impact your monthly bill. However, there is a much easier way of installation, wireless systems automatically transmit the signals between all the component parts of the burglar alarm to avoid the time consuming and sometimes unsightly wiring process.</p>
