<p>Large buildings require a central control panel to show staff and the fire brigade the location of a fire within the building if a fire is detected. Sprinkler systems look bad and will harm the building's appearance. Not all surveillance cameras are static. This box camera includes a 6-60 mm variable focal auto-iris lens which gives security installers a lot of flexibility to adjust the camera angle of view and zoom level.

When hiring an alarm or home security company, check to see if your state requires them to be licensed.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
