Most businesses do not routinely test their fire alarms and of those that do, many do not properly test the systems.</p>
<p>Home security systems that are 100% DIY let you pick the security products, set them up, and monitor them—all on your own. The camera transmits a signal to the receiving unit that can store the video signal in a proprietary DVR unit or in some cases directly onto a computer hard drive.

<p>A future home is a residence that uses internet-connected devices to enable the remote monitoring, management of appliances and security systems.

<p>Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
