In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>

<h4>Security Alarm System For Home Lubbock 79424</h4>
<p>Alarm systems that require wiring and sensor or camera placement benefit from professional installation companies—especially if an incorrectly placed motion sensor, door sensor, or security camera could lead to false alarms, or worse, an intruder. Small facilities like Banks, retail outlets, and small businesses ideally use the network video recorder to monitor their sites. Activation of a burglar alarm circuit is made when the switch detects the opening or closing of the circuit, for example opening a door or window.</p>
<p>When these perimeter sensors and interior motion detectors are part of a stand-alone system, the siren and flashing lights are the only deterrents for discouraging the intruder and thwarting the break-in. ADT offers pet-immune motion detectors, wireless components for easy integration into your home, and two-way voice capabilities. Cameras that are set on potential entry points that have DVR capabilities are a great way to help law enforcement personnel identify burglars and vandals.</p>
