From video collection only, to multi-dimensional data awareness: A Huawei Software Defined Camera (SDC) — with a full hardware series available, designed for diverse scenarios — converges cloud IoT data with media and information networks, to realize 360° awareness of people, vehicles, objects, the environment, and behaviors, mining multi-dimensional data for true value, and promising to comprehensively safeguard cities.</p>
<p>The cameras perform different functions depending on the type of surveillance system being used. They may also provide enhanced flexibility of building design and increase the overall level of fire safety. If the person is asleep when the alarm goes off, he won't see it. With this problem in mind, most deaf people have security systems with sensors. Because of this arrangement, these systems are actually monitoring and controlling circuits, and not individual devices.</p>
