<p>The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future. Additionally, what could be controlled through a smart phone app and whether there were false alarms and fast response times were deemed important as well.</p>
<p>Today's video surveillance systems aren't just about security cameras. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Homeowners who have installed burglar alarm systems statistically stand a better chance of avoiding invasion than those without protection.

A fire alarm system will initiate communications to other building automation and security systems to facilitate evacuation from the building and containment of the fire.</p>
<p>All companies and businesses should regularly carry out routine tests on their fire alarms but, in the UK, The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 also requires that fire alarm systems are properly tested and maintained, and the best way to do this is to use the services of an electrical contractor. Along with security cameras and devices to view and record camera images, Other pieces of surveillance equipment may be necessary to complete a video security system.</p>
<p>It is during this stage that early detection (either human or automatic), followed by a timely response by qualified fire emergency professionals, can control the fire before significant losses occur. Additionally, the cost of motion detector sensors, as well as special sensors that pick up on fire risks, high carbon monoxide levels, and even air conditioning problems, are very expensive. Monitoring a surveillance system can allow a business owner to make educated decisions on these matters.</p>
<p>Thus, the burglar alarm sound installed in a system should be loud and distinguishable enough for everyone in the premise to hear. There is a sensor or a group of sensors placed along strategic and vulnerable areas in the house such as doors and windows. CCTV cameras are limited to 4CIF, or 704 x 480, while IP cameras are well past to 3 megapixel, or 2048 x 1536.
