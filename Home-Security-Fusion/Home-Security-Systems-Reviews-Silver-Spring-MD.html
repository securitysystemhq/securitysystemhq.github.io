Cameras include Greet for the front door, Pivot for indoor monitoring, Torch Pro for lighting up and monitoring outdoors.

The Vivint Smart Home system is the best home security system as it's the most sophisticated and customizable systems on offer. Similar to the existing monitoring systems, the developed system has two interfaces, one for patients and other for the doctor.</p>
<p>Most home security cameras perform the same basic functions—they detect an event, record the event, and send you an alert—but they don't all perform them the same way. Two Remote Monitoring Centers ensure full coverage where professionals process information received from your devices and trigger the appropriate response, which includes logging the event, emailing and calling contacts, and escalating issues as needed and according to service agreements.</p>

<p>Alerts: A good outdoor security camera will alert your smartphone or tablet whenever motion is detected. A very important application for any DVR system is the ability to monitor live and access to recordings through remote access.

Delivering highest quality of relevant images, most efficient bitrates with lowest storage requirements and network strain, and keeping video data secure.
