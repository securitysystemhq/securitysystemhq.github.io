<p>In such cases, the only option remains is the burglar alarm systems; these alarm systems are electronic alarms designed to alert a user from unspecific danger. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery.
