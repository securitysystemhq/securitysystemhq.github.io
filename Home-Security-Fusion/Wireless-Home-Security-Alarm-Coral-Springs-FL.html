<p>Wireless internet CCTV cameras, also known as wireless IP cameras, are the digital replacement for traditional analogue CCTV. From video collection only, to multi-dimensional data awareness: A Huawei Software Defined Camera (SDC) — with a full hardware series available, designed for diverse scenarios — converges cloud IoT data with media and information networks, to realize 360° awareness of people, vehicles, objects, the environment, and behaviors, mining multi-dimensional data for true value, and promising to comprehensively safeguard cities.</p>

<p>Complete, high-quality audio systems to improve security, make live or scheduled announcements, or create ambience with great-sounding background music.

Excessive demand has decreased the rates of these CCTV Cameras.</p>
