<h3>Trying to Outsmart a Home Security System in Falls Church</h3>
<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do. What this means to the consumers is a sharper, crisper, and more detailed picture than what is achieved with analog. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>By showing your surveillance systems' recordings to police in given situations, you may even actually help solve crimes such as nearby break-ins. This is not, however, a straightforward question as there are many different types of burglar alarm system to consider.
