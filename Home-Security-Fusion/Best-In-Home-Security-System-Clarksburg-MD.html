<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>
<p>The newest technology in camera surveillance is the use of computers to interpret the data. The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device. Software Description: The Storage and Network Calculator software can calculate the saving time and required disk space for the recorded video files, and the bandwidth for transferring the video streams.</p>

<p>If you don't respond, the alarm monitoring service contacts the proper agency to dispatch emergency personnel to your address. The CCTV cameras involve the components that are used for direct generation, storage and displays of important data. Video surveillance technology in the form of photo enforcement, for example, helps officials recognize traffic flow and congestion areas. People may have less chance to escape safely as emergency lights won't operate and fire alarms are busted.</p>
