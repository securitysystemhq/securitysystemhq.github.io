As a homeowner, you need an integrated home monitoring system that can be controlled via a single interface and that can add comfort to your lifestyle.</p>
<p>Such systems continue to enjoy general public support but they do involve intrusion into the lives of ordinary people as they go about their day to day business and can raise wider privacy concerns. When you place a security company's sticker in a front window and plant their sign in your front yard, you are telling burglars you home is professionally protected and not a wise choice for an attempted burglary.</p>

It lets you order online, it has you install the equipment yourself, and it doesn't charge you an arm and a leg for professional monitoring (or equipment either, honestly).</p>
