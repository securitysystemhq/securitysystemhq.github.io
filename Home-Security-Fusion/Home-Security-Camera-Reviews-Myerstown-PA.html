Plus, most of these DIY systems are wireless, which is great for renters who can't drill holes in the wall.</p>
<p>Service Providers can give their customer, the homeowner, the power to monitor and control many devices in the home: Thermostats, door locks, lighting, cameras - while at home or away. Intelligent intrusion detection is a delicate balance between responding to real security breaches and ignoring costly false alarm sources. A properly selected sprinkler will detect the fire's heat, initiate alarm, and begin suppression within moments after flames appear.</p>

When you use a company with live monitoring services, you may get several interconnected command centers that are strategically located throughout the United States.

<p>Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you're an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
