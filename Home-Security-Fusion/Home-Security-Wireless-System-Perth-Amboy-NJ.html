Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>
