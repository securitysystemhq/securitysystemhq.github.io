<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors. To ensure the integrity of the footage, the camera must be located fairly close to the DVR and the number of ports on the DVR determines the number of cameras that can be connected. Fixed cameras are usually used for the main purpose of watching the flow of people passing by while dome cameras with PTZ functions are used for monitoring a crime-targeted place.</p>
<p>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission found that interconnected smoke alarms do a better job of detecting fires and alerting all occupants to danger.3 When it comes to safety, taking the extra step to install and connect hardwired smoke detectors is definitely worth it. The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>Ask the home security company for an itemized breakdown of all charges, which may include equipment costs, installation fees, monthly monitoring charges and more. The Digital Video Recorder also known as a DVR is used to take footage or video taken by a security camera and storing it as the name says, digitally, onto a hard drive. The camera uses a number of sensors to detect the presence of a person in the room and monitor their activities.</p>

<p>Hardwired systems are more permanent and won't suffer the susceptibility of interference that wireless systems sometime have. It is true that a home security system can be a significant expense, especially when initially installing it. The equipment and the skill it takes to ensure it is properly installed will run you a few hundred dollars or more (unless you buy a DIY type from top security camera brands , which you can install by yourself).</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at. You can never tell by looking at it in distance. One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally. A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing. The usual forms of such photoelectric burglar alarm systems operate on the absolute principle, i. e., the amount of light reaching the cell surface determines the voltage on the control grid of the associated vacuum tube.</p>
