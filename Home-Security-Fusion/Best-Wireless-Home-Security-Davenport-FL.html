<p>Large buildings require a central control panel to show staff and the fire brigade the location of a fire within the building if a fire is detected. Sprinkler systems look bad and will harm the building's appearance. Not all surveillance cameras are static. This box camera includes a 6-60 mm variable focal auto-iris lens which gives security installers a lot of flexibility to adjust the camera angle of view and zoom level. Also to provide high resolution and high quality videos, we have storage like DVRs, NVRs and many other solutions.
