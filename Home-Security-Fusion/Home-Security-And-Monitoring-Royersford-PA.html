<p>Section from our smart video doorbell guide. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company. In contrast, with a wireless system , the sensors relay information to the alarm panel via radio signals meaning cables are unnecessary. Such knowledge will stay with them even out of school when they are, for example, in other public buildings where a fire alarm bell goes off.</p>
<p>Video surveillance serves as the remote eyes for management and the security force. And you can use PoE security cameras or WiFi security cameras in areas with access to home WiFi Internet like your driveways, gateways or storefronts.
