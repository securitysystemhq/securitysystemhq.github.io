<p>When we talk of home security the first thing that springs to mind is alarm systems, however there is much more to it than calling in your local alarm installer. I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Motion activated cameras with DVR's are an excellent solution if you need to monitor a specific area or location such as a parking lot or parking garage. These panels range in scale from a single zone to multiple buildings. Cherry Labs has developed an AI-enabled camera that can be used for home monitoring applications.

<h3>Modern Security and Surveillance Systems For Your Home in Marshalltown</h3>
<p>As with their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and allow you to view live video from your phone. Nowadays, house alarms or home security systems are preferably needed to ensure the house security from burglars and criminals.

<p>Security cameras are also a common element of DIY home security systems. You can also opt to receive alerts on your smartphone if motion is sensed in a protected area inside or outside - giving you the information you need to act quickly.

Wireless alarm systems: These systems also don't require monitoring. Whether you're looking to install a CCTV camera outside a property to catch criminal activity, or have placed one inside to monitor the home or a company's goods, there's something for everyone.</p>
