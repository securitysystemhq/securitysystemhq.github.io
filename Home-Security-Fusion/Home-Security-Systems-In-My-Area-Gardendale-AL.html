<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
