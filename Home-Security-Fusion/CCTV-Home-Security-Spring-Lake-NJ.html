<p>The importance of a properly installed fire alarm system is not to be overlooked. Along with high resolution images, Matrix IP cameras decrease storage costs by offering latest H.265 Compression technology. Finally, experts state that a home without an alarm system is three times more likely to be burglarized than a home with a professionally monitored system installed. With the latest smart home technology from your favourite security brands, deterring burglars and detecting trespassers has never been easier.</p>

Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. This isn't the cheapest package Protect America offers, but we think it provides solid home security that's still affordable. Burglar alarms systems are increasingly being used in private homes, offices, stores and other businesses.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. While wireless home security systems are popular and known for an easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more reliable because they aren't subject to interference.</p>

Additionally, the cost of motion detector sensors, as well as special sensors that pick up on fire risks, high carbon monoxide levels, and even air conditioning problems, are very expensive.
