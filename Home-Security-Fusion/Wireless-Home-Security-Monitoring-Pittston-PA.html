<p>Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of individual sensors or groups. Currently, Ring Alarm and the professional monitoring service are available only within the U.S. (excluding American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada (excluding Quebec). Video surveillance cameras have two main types of connections: wired or wireless.

<p>Indoor cameras are designed to sit inside and monitor an area. Several security systems offer integrations with popular voice activation hubs like Amazon Alexa, but experts predict companies that are moving toward voice controls will become obsolete. That means you can add, for example, a smart speaker to arm, disarm, and check system status with the sound of your voice, as well as trigger cameras or lights to go on based on alerts or your location.</p>
