<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness. An annual fee is charged for alarm monitoring, this is typically paid directly to the alarm company. All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios. A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>Chemical Plants - Security cameras are used where humans cannot go.

The equipment and the skill it takes to ensure it is properly installed will run you a few hundred dollars or more (unless you buy a DIY type from top security camera brands , which you can install by yourself).</p>
<p>Lastly, a video surveillance camera can be used to enforce quality control at emissions test centers, where the amount of pollutants that a vehicle produces is tested. If these devices are installed indoors, they can assist with capturing criminals involved in home invasions and burglaries, as well as monitoring babysitters and nannies.

The presence of security cameras can serve as a deterrent to would-be thieves, while hidden cameras can protect discretely.</p>
<p>These professionals have to monitor the CCTV video evidence on a timely manner and they have to be appropriately trained in order to deduce suspicious behavior caught on the CCTV camera. The ability to deter potential thieves, catch shoplifters, monitor cash registers, identify visitors, as well as increasing the security in and around your home and business area will reward you with a peace of mind.

<p>Such cameras are available in multiple types such as in Dome or Bullet shaped Cameras. Once an image has been picked by the camera, it is taken to the monitor and then recorded on video tape or DVR.

Coax based cameras produce video that is encoded by the DVR, thus allowing picture quality to be modified before the video is saved by the DVR.</p>
<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
