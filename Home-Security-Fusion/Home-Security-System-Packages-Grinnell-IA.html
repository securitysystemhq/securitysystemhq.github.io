They also have a regular inspection schedule for checking out public buildings and their fire safety equipment.</p>

Alder does not have a selection of pre-made packages you can choose from, but works with customers to build out security systems that are best for their homes.

<p>This type of burglar alarm system is of cord-type, and it is limited for small distances due to usage of cables. If a genuine smoke or fire condition exists, the detector will reenter the alarm mode immediately after the reset attempt.
