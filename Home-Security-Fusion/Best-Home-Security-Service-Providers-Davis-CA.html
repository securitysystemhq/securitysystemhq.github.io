<p>If you're asking about the greatest investment you can ever come by, the answer is neither a house nor a car. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>These cameras can help monitor who's at the door and can record video when the doorbell is pushed. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras.

Having such features will enable you more flexibility with remote or voice controls and without having to physically handle these systems manually.</p>
