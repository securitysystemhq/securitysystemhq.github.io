Pro Series DVRs support HD videos, H.265 Pro+ and H.265 encoding technology, 4K resolution output, power over coax (PoC), multiple VCA events, and more. A non-monitored burglar alarm system operates on a â€˜bells only' basis - in other words, when triggered, its only function is sounding an alarm to alert neighbours and hopefully scare off the intruder.</p>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

Through video surveillance cameras, managers of restaurants or hotels can determine whether or not their staffs are following proper sanitation measures. With the launch of IP cameras there came another method of recoding and storing footage taken by CCTV systems. Many cities and motorway networks have extensive traffic-monitoring systems, using closed-circuit television to detect congestion and notice accidents.</p>
<p>Both Total Connect and will allow the user to remotely arm and disarm their panel, check the status of their system and control any Z-Wave devices that have been installed with the panel. This effective alarm system functions very well as it can detect movements even through thick walls and can make an angry bark of a dog that gets louder and fiercer as the intruder advances. Alarm systems may be monitored by a call centre who will get notified if the alarm gets triggered who will dispatch emergency services, or they may be unmonitored i.e. it'll just set off a loud siren inside and outside the house when the alarm is tripped and you'll have to take necessary action by yourself.</p>
