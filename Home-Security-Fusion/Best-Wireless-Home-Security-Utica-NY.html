Modern systems offer fire and smoke detection, as well as being able to alert the monitoring center to your plight. DFS Alarm Receiving Centre works round the clock to receive and respond to signals from the alarm systems at your home or shop.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at. You can never tell by looking at it in distance. One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally.

<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets.

They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
