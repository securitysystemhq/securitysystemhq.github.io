<p>So you're interested in purchasing a CCTV camera for either home security or for commercial use, but you don't know what type of camera to purchase? For microcontroller MC2 , keypad is connected to port 1 and LCD display is connected to port 2 and motor driver is connected to pins P1.2 and P1.3 and touch sensor is connected to pin P1.4.

<p>Many residents and businesses are now utilizing surveillance cameras and these cameras may capture persons and events without the owner's knowledge and this captured information may help the police department solve crimes and help keep the Borough safe. The Smonet outdoor security camera is equipped with night vision, wide-angle lens and 720p HD video quality. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small.</p>

<p>There are two parts to how much a home security system costs: equipment and monitoring. With prices for monitoring from $35 to $50 for most, the company is just a little more expensive than some. If you want to add extras like cameras or security lighting, the up-front equipment price gets a lot steeper—but there's no company that can beat Ring's $10 a month monitoring fee. A burglar alarm system consists of a series of electrical components that are connected to a property.</p>

<p>Home security systems that are 100% DIY let you pick the security products, set them up, and monitor them—all on your own. The camera transmits a signal to the receiving unit that can store the video signal in a proprietary DVR unit or in some cases directly onto a computer hard drive.
