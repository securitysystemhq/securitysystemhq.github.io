<p>Whenever there is an unauthorized entry into the house, the system identifies it and alerts by the production of a loud alarm. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. The detector identifies any smoke or heat in the building or if someone uses the manual breakpoint. It is sometimes the case where an alarm panel or wiring is attacked by an intruder and oftentimes the equipment is damaged beyond repair.</p>
