<p>Nowadays, all buildings are required to have some sort of fire prevention system in place to ensure the safety of the building's occupants in the event of a fire.

Fire alarm systems typically consist of several inter-linked components, such as smoke detectors, heat detector, carbon monoxide, manual call points, sounders, alarm and buzzer. Wireless systems are can be configured to call a telephone or cell phone number (requires the unit being connected to a telephone line) in case the alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>Cameras on a cutting edge simple CCTV framework send their video in the conventional base band organize over cajole or UTP cabling back to a computerized video recorder (DVR).

<p>With the wireless burglar alarm system, you do not need a trained electrician to install it for you. A common misconception about our camera systems is that all cameras have to be the same resolution, which is not the case. At the same time a small CCTV camera is watching to capture and transmit back the details of your pin code number. The main purpose of the this fire safety equipment is to make the fire known so that people can immediately evacuate the location while those who are entrusted as fire wardens can carry out the necessary emergency procedures.</p>

<p>By showing your surveillance systems' recordings to police in given situations, you may even actually help solve crimes such as nearby break-ins. This is not, however, a straightforward question as there are many different types of burglar alarm system to consider. Imagine a medium sized company that charges $ 25.00 for alarm monitoring every month. Sometimes that means a human watching live footage, usually from multiple video feeds.</p>
<p>Alarm-monitoring companies have enjoyed the benefit of police response to their customers' alarms without any accountability for the accuracy or reliability of those alarms.

Videos from both IP cameras and analog cameras can be transferred over the computer network whereas unlike analog cameras, IP cameras can connect directly to an IP network.</p>
<p>A Bloomberg Business study of the effects of surveillance at 392 restaurants showed that where surveillance cameras were in place and operational, businesses saw a 22 percent drop in theft AND a 7 percent increase in profits. You can send many streams of video from dozens of cameras at one time, giving you a single wire network that allows hundreds of simultaneous full frame video streams. These kinds of systems often work in conjunction with smart home systems, such as Z-Wave.</p>
