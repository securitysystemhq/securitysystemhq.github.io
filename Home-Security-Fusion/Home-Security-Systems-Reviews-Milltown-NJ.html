Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on gives you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away. The detection principle of an Addressable System is the same as a Conventional System except that each detector is given a set Address (usually by means of a dip-switch) and the Control Panel can then determine exactly which detector or call point has initiated the alarm.</p>
<p>The system's cameras are generally placed near entrances, hallways, stairwells, common areas and parking lots that are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Microphonic systems vary in design but each is generally based on the detection of an intruder attempting to cut or climb over a chainwire fence.
