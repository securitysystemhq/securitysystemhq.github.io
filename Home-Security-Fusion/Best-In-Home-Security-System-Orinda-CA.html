<p>It seems like the question of how a fire alarm system works passes through everyone's mind at some point or another. All of the systems in this article are installed by professionals, which are good for those who don't have the time, patience, or expertise to install all the requisite sensors and equipment. Indoor alarm systems will allow monitoring within the house. In these cases, wireless video cameras are popping up to fill the void.

<p>They provide a very low false alarm rate, and have a very high chance of detecting real burglars.

Alarms are also provided to alert building management when a sprinkler valve is closed. Mission effectiveness of a fire alarm safety system is based on four factors: Design, equipment, installation, and maintenance.</p>
<p>The new and improved Brinks Home Security uses MONI monitoring and Livewatch DIY security systems for a more modern package.
