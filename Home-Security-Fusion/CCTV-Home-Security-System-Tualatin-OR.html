<p>Equipment: It is another factor to consider in choosing the burglar alarm system. These companies then provide their products to thousands of dealers that sell the equipment and install the alarm systems. Because smart home security doesn't just have to be about keeping potential burglars away. We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.</p>
<p>The sensors have two parts, similar to the wired and wireless systems. Video doorbell cameras are fit for purpose but they don't do much for exposed walkways and outside spaces.
