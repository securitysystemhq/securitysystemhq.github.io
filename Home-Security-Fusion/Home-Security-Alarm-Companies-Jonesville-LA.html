You can watch the downhole images which are sent to the surface unit by the camera in realtime and the video data are recorded to disk in a standard video file on the notebook or the VHS tape or the camcorder. Setting up a smart security system is relatively easy these days, with each gadget synching over Wi-Fi, but it's vital you take time to position sensors and cameras correctly to cover every vulnerable area.</p>
