If you have the extra bandwidth on your network, the higher quality video and easier setup of NVR is likely the best choice.</p>
<p>Hybrid video recorders (HVR) are video surveillance systems that run both IP cameras and analog cameras. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. These can be photoelectric smoke and warmth indicators, ionization smoke identifiers, warm locators, in-channel smoke finders, physically worked pull stations and sprinkler water stream sensors.</p>
<p>You can install one of these systems on your PC and record up to four wired or wireless cameras.
