DVRs can save CCTV data for up to 10 weeks of recording time and there are even some which has motion detection technology. Southwark shows how CCTV cameras - that fully adhere to the UK code of conduct - are used to help catch criminals and keep people safe. Surveillance cameras aren't just for crime prevention anymore, unless you are advertising the fact that the property has surveillance camera's installed to deter would be criminals.</p>
<p>Take note that the control panel should be of easy access, that means it should be placed into a spot wherein the homeowner of the household members have direct access to it. However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
