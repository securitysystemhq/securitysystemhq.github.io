However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan. Dome cameras are typically used for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The central module connects at the Internet via WiFi and through an application we can remotely monitor the state of the house or control various devices within the enclosure. Abode's small scale makes it easy to forgo professional monitoring, especially if your main goal is to stay connected to what's happening at home instead of deterring intruders.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>

As you can guess, with alarm monitoring worth so much, many of the family run alarm companies cashed out long ago.

Some people love the idea that they can install the system themselves, while others are concerned about being able to do the installation correctly.</p>
