<p>The police recommend home owners install a visual burglar alarm” with a box on the outside of the house. In a third form of photoelectric detection system that may be termed a pulse system, changes in the amount of radiation of either visible or invisible light will cause an alarm by tripping a vacuum tube. At the same time, the digital display will be lighted and the alarm place will be watched. If the door is kicked in or a window is broken, the sensors are tripped, an alarm rings and help is called.</p>
<p>If the door or a window was opened and the electric circuit closed, the sudden flow of current caused one of the attached magnets in the system to vibrate. Other output functions include shutting down electrical equipment such as computers, shutting off air handling fans to prevent smoke migration, and shutting down operations such as chemical movement through piping in the alarmed area. Dome security cameras are an excellent choice for home coverage.</p>
