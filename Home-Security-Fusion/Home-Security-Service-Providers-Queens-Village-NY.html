A properly selected sprinkler will detect the fire's heat, initiate alarm, and begin suppression within moments after flames appear.</p>
<p>Dome CCTV cameras. As you will be installing a very large system of CCTV cameras, there will be some inconvenience with respect to the length of the cable.

This home security camera stands out with customized notifications, video analytics, and seamless integration with the Vivint Sky smart home platform.</p>
