Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>

<p>You can also find smart security cameras and lights to augment your home's security. Analog security systems - the recorded images or footage is sent to the DVR recorder (Digital Video Recorder) using a coaxial cable. Motion sensor systems are battery-operated with strategic alerts to signal the control panel when running low.

<p>This allows the CCTV camera to increase the video image quality in low light conditions. Motion detection recording means only record when video camera detect movement, then it will start to record, no motion, then no record. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, but it's not so much when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity.</p>
