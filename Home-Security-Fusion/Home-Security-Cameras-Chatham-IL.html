<p>Fire alarms are important security devices which help to seek protection against fire accidents. If you have an Xfinity X1 cable TV box, you can control the system from there and watch live video from the camera. We specialize in providing an extensive range of CCTV cameras, and performing research and development in Camera DSP (Digital Signal Processors) for other renowned manufacturers. You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. Smoke detectors connected to your smart home hub are able to alert your phone, so you know when there's an emergency even when you aren't home.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarmâ€”if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>
