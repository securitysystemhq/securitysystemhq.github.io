<p>A fire alarm annunciator is basically a control panel that helps you monitor and control all elements of your fire alarm system from a central station. Avoid overlapping camera views, do not install them with source of light directly in front of it and do not place infrared cameras pointing at each other to eliminate risk of overexposure.
