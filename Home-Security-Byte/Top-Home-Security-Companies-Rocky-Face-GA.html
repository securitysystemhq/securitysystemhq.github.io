<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. There may be no way to avoid the occasional angry or unstable customer, disgruntled employee, parent, violent intruder or disturbed individual, but the installation of a panic system is a great way to mitigate the danger and prepare for it.

<p>Most outdoor cameras, like our current top pick, the Arlo Ultra , offer motion detection with push and email notifications, night vision, and cloud storage for event-triggered video, and some, like the Ring Floodlight Cam , pull double duty as floodlights or porch lights.
