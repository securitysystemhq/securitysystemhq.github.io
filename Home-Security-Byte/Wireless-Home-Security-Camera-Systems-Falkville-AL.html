<p>Isolated areas are more dangerous and thieves and frauds can attack these houses easily which are without any burglar alarm system. And modern alarm sensors mean even dog and cat owners can have alarms installed that are clever enough to allow pets to roam without triggering the siren. This feature, known as Listed Integral Sensitivity Testing, allows facilities personnel to service only those detectors that need attention, rather than requiring a labor and time consuming cleaning of all units.</p>
