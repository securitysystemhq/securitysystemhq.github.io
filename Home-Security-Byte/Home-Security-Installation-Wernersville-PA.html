<p>Many people share a grave misconception about the use and application of fire alarm systems. This security camera is pretty generic and provides a decent quality of about 720p resolution. Closed circuit television is one of the most effective and commonly used types of video surveillance available on the market, but is a step above in price from wireless cameras.
