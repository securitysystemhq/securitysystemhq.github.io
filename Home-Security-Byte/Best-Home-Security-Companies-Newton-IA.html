<h3>Modern Security and Surveillance Systems For the Home in Newton</h3>
<p>These are the best indoor home security cameras in our testing. Two-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what's going on gives you a more complete picture of what's happening on the home front when you're away. The detection principle of an Addressable System is the same as a Conventional System except that each detector is given a set Address (usually by means of a dip-switch) and the Control Panel can then determine exactly which detector or call point has initiated the alarm.</p>

That's where commercial-grade security camera systems can come in handy. Actually, the wireless CCTV camera type only sends data wirelessly and it still needs a cable for power supply, which set it apart from the truly wire-free CCTV camera types. Video surveillance cameras are available in the price range of $100 to $800 for the most part.</p>
