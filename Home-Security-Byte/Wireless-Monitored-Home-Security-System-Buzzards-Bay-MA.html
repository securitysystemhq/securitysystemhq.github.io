Our security camera systems are based on this simple principle to allow easy video download to a USB drive and playback on a Windows or Mac computer. If any one of these systems is malfunctioning, the monitor can make you aware of the situation and dispatch service personnel to your home to make sure your system continues to function.</p>

If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
