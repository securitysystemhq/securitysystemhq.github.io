The standard size is 380 TVL to 420 TVL cameras high quality up to 480 TVL to 570 TVL. Few do-it-yourself wired systems contain movement detectors, but they can usually be added as an extra. Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera's field of view and trigger video recording.</p>
<p>I will focused on standard CCTV monitor, standalone DVR recorder and distribution power supply, as this is the most popular and likely solution for most CCTV installations. Look for models with multiple sensors - motion and heat for instance - that helps to reduce the number of false alerts.
