<p>Many cities, businesses, and individuals have installed Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) cameras for surveillance purposes. The list of services to be monitored at a Central Station has expanded over the past few years to include: Access Control ; CCTV Monitoring; Alarm Verification; Environmental Monitoring; Intrusion Alarm Monitoring; Fire Alarm & Sprinkler Monitoring; Critical Condition Monitoring; Medical Response Monitoring; Elevator Telephone Monitoring; Hold-Up or Panic Alarm Monitoring; Duress Monitoring; Auto Dialer tests; Open & Close Signal Supervision & Reporting; Exception Reports; and PIN or Passcode Management.</p>
