<p>Depending on your requirements you can go with any home security system through which you can monitor the security or maybe if not interested in getting the whole system there are ample individual devices available that let you check your home via mobile or your smart devices. If our main pick is not available or you just want basic coverage without having to subscribe to a service, the Logitech Circle 2 is an excellent alternative that includes 24 hours of free cloud storage (with an option to purchase more ). This camera performs very similarly to the Nest Cam Outdoor, with the capability to deliver crystal-clear 1080p images day and night and with two-way communication so you can hear and talk to whoever is in front of the camera.</p>
<p>These CCTV camera security systems are sizable in door as well as outdoor uses. However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale are DIY-installed systems costing as little as Â£200. The monitoring company has guards watching the screens 24 hours a day just waiting to receive an alarm distress call. There's also a smartphone app and smart home compatibility built-in as well as optional monitoring from ADT and cellular backup. CP PLUS' extensive portfolio of products include state-of-the-art cameras, DVRs, that is simple to set up and use.</p>

The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>
