<p>When choosing a video surveillance system, you want to go with the best video quality for the buck, and with a Network IP camera, there are 10 reasons why you should consider them over 20th century CCTV cameras. However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan.

Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>Check out our comprehensive review to compare top alarm systems and features. Quick action is important during break-ins, and burglar alarms facilitate fast response by alerting people in the vicinity to compromised security as soon as it occurs. This can often reduce glare in a video camera surveillance system.
