<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>

Security cameras can be used not only to monitor the inside of a building but to survey the outside areas like car parks and perimeter fences.</p>
<p>It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party. When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered.

Active and faster response - You may have the best home security measures in your house, but if the kind of security system you have fails to get quick response from the outside or from third party monitoring such as quick connection to fire departments, law enforcements and other authorities, your system is useless and may need some major overhaul, or if not, a complete replacement.</p>

<p>These can be fitted with timers so that they come on only during the night, and using low-energy bulbs makes them very inexpensive to leave on. You will have full colour images all night and even if you need to buy several lights it will likely be far less expensive than a camera with infra-red capability. All they need is access to the IP camera's network via the Internet. If your alarm is set and your home security is breached your alarm system will automatically and immediately send a distress signal to the monitoring company.</p>
<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having police walk the streets. As cameras are just one part of security, they do not stop unauthorized entry and, in most cases, don't trigger an alert to authorities to check your business. They can initiate different actions reflecting different types of problems (for example, different alarms for burglars as for fire).</p>
