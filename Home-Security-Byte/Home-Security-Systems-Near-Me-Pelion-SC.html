<p>Regardless of the size of your home, or the number of doors and windows or interior rooms a homeowner decides to protect, the only real difference is in the number of security components deployed throughout the home and monitored by the control panel.

<p>For instance, to handle the needs of outdoor surveillance, you must ensure that the security cameras system that you are planning to buy is weatherproof.
