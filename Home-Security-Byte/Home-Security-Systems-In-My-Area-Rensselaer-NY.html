I am so glad that you have mentioned about smart home integration Just last week I was given bunch of cameras to install by a home owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. We've seen so many companies upgrade their equipment or add in new smart home features that we had to take a totally new look at the alarm systems out there. Once inside, the circuit system is not effective anymore since it is not practical to set up circuits in every inch of the house.</p>

We understand that pre-packaged security systems sometimes don't always fit well, that's why we offer our build your security camera system option. 1.

CCTV cameras are just there to give the public a false feeling of safety and are a less effective replacement for policing.</p>

All of the systems we've tested feature an app that lets you use your smartphone as your command center to arm and disarm the system, create rules, add and delete components, and receive push notifications when alarms are triggered. These cameras are designed to provide high definition, crystal clear images and at the same time withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p>

The difference being that with CCTV camera security systems there are no wires between any number of cameras you might employ and the TV set or sets you might choose to view them from.</p>
