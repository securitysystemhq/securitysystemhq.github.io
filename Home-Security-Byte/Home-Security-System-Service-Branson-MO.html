This would include a wide set of options such as sirens, sensors, magnetic switches, ultrasonic detectors, microwave detectors and security cameras.</p>
<p>In this instance, we're talking about home security systems, which are networks of integrated electronic devices working together with a central control panel to protect against burglars and other potential home intruders. Mounted in places such as driveways, parking lots, parking garages, and car alarm stores, video surveillance cameras are valuable in protecting one's investment. Smoke and fire detectors that aren't wired directly into your alarm system cannot summon emergency personnel.</p>

If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
