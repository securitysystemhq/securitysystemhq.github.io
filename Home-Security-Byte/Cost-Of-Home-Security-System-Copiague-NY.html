<p>Once you recognize that everywhere, including Tucson, home security is first and foremost about the safety and security of your family, your choice of a security system and the company that installs and monitors the equipment becomes one of the most important decisions you will make. The wide deployment of sensing technologies in our daily living environments and the pervasive usage of mobile devices bring about great opportunities for the deployment of smoke alarms 1 At present, most of the traditional smoke alarm systems consist of sensor modules, transmission lines, and monitors, each of which is connected to a sensor module 2 Therefore, there is a defect in the accuracy and timeliness of the traditional alarm system.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit.

An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>A:A major difference between a surveillance camera and a security camera is that the surveillance cameras are supposed to take less detailed view, as the camera images are being monitored at the same time.

IP cameras or network cameras are analogue or digital video cameras, plus an embedded video server having an IP address , capable of streaming the video (and sometimes, even audio). If it is not a false alarm, or the homeowner is absent from the premises and can not say if it is a false alarm or not, then the home security alarm monitoring company will contact your local police department so they can take timely action.</p>
