<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>

However, some of the security camera systems installed by government security agencies are more complex, and take more time to install.

<p>Lastly, a video surveillance camera can be used to enforce quality control at emissions test centers, where the amount of pollutants that a vehicle produces is tested.

Video surveillance cameras have two main types of connections: wired or wireless.
