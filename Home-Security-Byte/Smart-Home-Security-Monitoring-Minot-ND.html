<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>On the basis of regional analysis, global CCTV cameras market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. These sensors monitor body heat and when an intruder walks into view of the PIR, it detects the increased body heat and triggers the alarm to be activated. These smoke alarms work really well.

<p>Then, the problem of low precision and weak timeliness of traditional smoke alarms is given. Its smart home panel lets the system learn your habits, so it knows when to turn up the heat or dim the lights based on your routine and preferences. An Intelligent Video Surveillance system basically censored the performance, happenings, or changing information usually in terms of human beings, vehicles or any other objects from a distance by means of some electronic equipment (usually digital camera).</p>
<p>Some security systems also use smart sensors to listen” for CO and smoke alarms. A high-quality home security camera system is one of the easiest ways to deter criminals from breaking into a home. Some outdoor CCTV surveillance camera systems are manually operated meaning a security personnel views the images and videos transmitted by the cameras from a specific location; and there are also those that can be operated remotely.</p>
<p>Once the system detects intrusion, the house security system will send a sign either to the local police or to the monitoring company. That's where commercial-grade security camera systems can come in handy. Actually, the wireless CCTV camera type only sends data wirelessly and it still needs a cable for power supply, which set it apart from the truly wire-free CCTV camera types.
