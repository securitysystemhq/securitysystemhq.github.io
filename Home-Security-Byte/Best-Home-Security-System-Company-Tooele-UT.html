<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

Panoramic security cameras, also known as 360-degree cameras, face in all directions and can be a great forensic tool.

Prevention is always better, so dummy alarm boxes and outdoor security cameras and lights are also great options.

Active and faster response - You may have the best home security measures in your house, but if the kind of security system you have fails to get quick response from the outside or from third party monitoring such as quick connection to fire departments, law enforcements and other authorities, your system is useless and may need some major overhaul, or if not, a complete replacement.</p>
<p>PTZ cameras are remotely controlled, and allow the operator to pan (move left or right), tilt up and or down, or zoom closer or farther away in order to follow people as they move. If something goes wrong with any of your Protect America equipment, the company will swap out the defective item for a brand new one. The Meraki dashboard provides secure monitoring and management of all your cameras from anywhere in the world.</p>
