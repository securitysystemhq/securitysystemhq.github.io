<p>With the different purposes of surveillance cameras, there is also a need for different types of these cameras in order to accomplish certain purposes. In their first decades of existence, CCTV cameras were low-resolution analog devices that recorded onto tapes. Up to 32 control panels and parallel indicator panels - can be linked redundantly to a ring network. Hikvision's PanoVu Series cameras are perfectly designed for this purpose.</p>
<p>Most providers highlight that their systems are easy to install, and usually that's through adhesive mounting or setting on a level surface.

<p>We've reviewed all the major professional install and DIY security options to help you determine which is the best home security system for you. There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>
<p>And the software also provides other functions, like wiper control, editing password, restoring default settings, and batch upgrading. Directly attached storage are the hard drives that are located outside of the digital video recorder, network video recorder or server. Some providers have motion sensors that are designed to be pet-friendly, avoiding pets under 80 pounds to help prevent false alarms. Both battery powered and hardwired, (but not wired into an alarm system), smoke or fire detectors have very limited value.</p>

Critical information is sent by your home security system to the alarm monitoring center, including account identification (to access your address and contact information) and the type of sensor that has been triggered.</p>
