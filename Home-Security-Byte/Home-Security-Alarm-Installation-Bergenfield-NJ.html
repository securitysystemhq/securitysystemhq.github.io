<p>No society in the world is crimeless. The thermal imaging technology has drastically evolved since then, and thermal imaging cameras have evolved to become compact in size and look like a digital photo camera, they are now easy to use and produce real-time crisp high-resolution images making them a widely important tool for industrial applications 8 They can detect anomalies that are generally invisible to the naked human eye, thus taking corrective preventing costly systems going for a total breakdown.</p>

<p>More recently, decentralized IP cameras , perhaps equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation. It is now possible for them to sort problems out themselves, by identifying triggers and minimising false alarms.

In general, each building needs a high-quality fire alarm system that will detect even a tiny bit of smoke and sound an alarm so that everyone can safely evacuate the building. Addressable fire alarms have a specially dedicated address for each fire alarm detector that is connected to the control panel, for easier identification of the source of the danger.</p>
<p>All these things working in unison and correctly have often saved the lives of people who were in buildings that have caught fire. Upon receiving an alarm notification, the fire alarm control panel must now tell someone that an emergency is underway. For one, cameras should avoid or mask inappropriate views of private areas, such as yards and windows of bedrooms or washrooms. This gives you better image quality, flexibility and scalability in a lower cost to operate than traditional CCTV cameras.</p>
