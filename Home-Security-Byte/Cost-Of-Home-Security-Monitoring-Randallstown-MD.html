If our main pick is not available or you just want basic coverage without having to subscribe to a service, the Logitech Circle 2 is an excellent alternative that includes 24 hours of free cloud storage (with an option to purchase more ).

Other systems using infrared technology detect motion in a room and set off an alarm. Stream live video and talk to anyone inside your home with our HD indoor security camera.</p>
