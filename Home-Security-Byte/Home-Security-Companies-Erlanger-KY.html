<p>It's hard to know just how important the right fire safety equipment will be unless you've been through a fire and have already experienced it. The fact is that the proper equipment can save lives. In reality it does not work that well, as extreme weather may often cause false alarms. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm.
