Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>

<p>Of the many types of burglar alarm, one of the biggest defining factors for a system is whether the alarm is wired or wireless. This means when your alarm is activated and your monitoring company gets the signal, they will try to call the location to cancel the alarm.

<p>It is during this stage that early detection (either human or automatic), followed by a timely response by qualified fire emergency professionals, can control the fire before significant losses occur. Additionally, the cost of motion detector sensors, as well as special sensors that pick up on fire risks, high carbon monoxide levels, and even air conditioning problems, are very expensive. Monitoring a surveillance system can allow a business owner to make educated decisions on these matters.</p>
