In combination, a light source, a pair of lenses spaced apart to divide light from said source into two protective light beams, a light chopper cooperating with said lenses and shaped to normally pass a constant amount of light and to pass a varying amount of light when one light beam is intercepted, a photoelectric means for receiving and converting said light into electric energy whereby modification of either of said light beams causes a varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said photoelectric means and means responsive to the varying voltage for operating an alarm system.</p>

DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>

One-stage fire alarm systems warn everyone in the building that a sensor has been activated. Some devices can only be controlled by a remote control whilst others can be controlled in multiple ways: a physical switch on the device itself, a remote control, and a smartphone or any web-enabled device.</p>
