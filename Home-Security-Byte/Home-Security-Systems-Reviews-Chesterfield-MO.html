<p>We've reviewed all the major professional install and DIY security options to help you determine which is the best home security system for you. There are many types of surveillance cameras such as dome cameras, hidden cameras, smoke detecting cameras, and "smart" cameras that are equipped with motion detectors. Commonly Heat detectors work in a similar way to an electrical fuse, the detectors contain a eutectic alloy which is heat sensitive when a certain temperature is reached the alloy turns from a solid to a liquid which in turn triggers the alarm.</p>
