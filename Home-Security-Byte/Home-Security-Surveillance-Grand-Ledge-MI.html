<p>All buildings need to have fire safety equipment in order to ensure the safety of the people who occupy the building. Instead, it wirelessly transmits the video signal to a wireless receiver that is connected to your recording or viewing device. A few more advanced home security camera systems like our Alnet PC-Based DVR Systems and H.264 standalone DVR systems provide advanced remote viewing features that will even allow you to remotely record video to a PC over the internet. They are equipped with ½” CMOS progressive scan sensors which allows the device to pick up high-quality images and doesn't require an extra light source - which makes the perfect night time security surveillance camera.</p>

However, the cameras themselves are too limited in their picture and sound quality to compare well with the current competition, while the app doesn't offer the same slick features of the latest IP cameras from Nest, Netatmo and others towards the top of this list. Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>Set up video cameras in company parking lots and outside the building to record criminal activity and allow company security officers to insure that employees reach their vehicles safely. They are great for those in rented accommodation as they can be removed just as easily as they were installed so when you move on to your new home, you can take the alarm system with you. Fire alarms reduce property loss: While strobe lights and sirens don't actively put out fires, they alert the people who can.</p>
