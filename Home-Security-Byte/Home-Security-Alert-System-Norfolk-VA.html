<p>So you're interested in purchasing a CCTV camera for either home security or for commercial use, but you don't know what type of camera to purchase? For microcontroller MC2 , keypad is connected to port 1 and LCD display is connected to port 2 and motor driver is connected to pins P1.2 and P1.3 and touch sensor is connected to pin P1.4. Motion detector is connected to pin P3.3 and taken as a input interrupt (INT1) to the microcontroller 2. The password request switch is connected to pin P3.2 and taken as a input interrupt (INT0) to the microcontroller.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble.

As shown in Figure 7 , the intelligent smoke alarm system consists of a smoke detection module, wireless communication module, and intelligent identification and data visualization module. Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>
<p>Efficiency of burglar alarms depends on the zone triggered, number of zones, time of the day and other aspects installed within the monitoring system.
