<p>All buildings need to have fire safety equipment in order to ensure the safety of the people who occupy the building. Instead, it wirelessly transmits the video signal to a wireless receiver that is connected to your recording or viewing device. A few more advanced home security camera systems like our Alnet PC-Based DVR Systems and H.264 standalone DVR systems provide advanced remote viewing features that will even allow you to remotely record video to a PC over the internet. They are equipped with ½” CMOS progressive scan sensors which allows the device to pick up high-quality images and doesn't require an extra light source - which makes the perfect night time security surveillance camera.</p>
<p>Fires can happen at any time and therefore, the water supply must be in a constant state of readiness. An annual fee is charged for alarm monitoring, this is typically paid directly to the alarm company. All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios. A wired security system is connected by small, low-voltage wires; because such a system requires routing wire discreetly throughout the house, it's usually installed by an alarm company, although some do-it-yourself models are available.</p>
<p>A monitoring company will get in touch with the emergency contact for the address, check on the situation, and in emergencies, contact the police or fire department. A hidden camera surveillance system is great for the nooks and crannies of your business where covert actions may take place.

<p>In wireless systems, the signal from the detectors to the control panel is transmitted with radio frequency. If the camera is connected to the internet directly without a computer or DVR, you can access the video from anywhere in the world, but you will not be making a time stamped recording. Note too that security systems aren't just about crime prevention: Most have add-on sensors that can protect your home from fire, flood, and even temperature changes (to prevent pipes from bursting, for one thing).</p>
<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away” or Stay” mode.

Motion detection recording means only record when video camera detect movement, then it will start to record, no motion, then no record.
