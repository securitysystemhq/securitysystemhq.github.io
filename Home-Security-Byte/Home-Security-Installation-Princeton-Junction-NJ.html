The Zmodo wireless security camera system is IP65-certified weatherproof and 720p HD night vision within 65 feet. In this chapter an introduction to most of the current video technology and equipment has been described.</p>
<p>All these capabilities make alarm systems more robust, not only in terms of security but also in terms of supervision flexibility. The British Security Industry Association (BSIA) estimates that, of the approximate eight million homes with alarms, 30% are audible-only alarms - alarms that ring or have a siren but are not monitored - and just 2% are remotely monitored alarms. The H.264 codec greatly reduces the size of your digital video files without compromising video quality.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated many times that camera recording can be used to solve crimes. Video surveillance systems involve strategic placement of security cameras, monitoring motion and activity, generating alerts, transmitting footage, and storing that footage. The latest (2018) crime statistics suggest 31% of homes now have a burglar alarm of some sort, down slightly from last year (32%), but part of a general rising trend.</p>
<p>All these things working in unison and correctly have often saved the lives of people who were in buildings that have caught fire. Upon receiving an alarm notification, the fire alarm control panel must now tell someone that an emergency is underway. For one, cameras should avoid or mask inappropriate views of private areas, such as yards and windows of bedrooms or washrooms.

Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Home security doors and home security windows with special locks and sensors add to your protection. CCTV surveillance systems are usually supported by the police or security professionals.
