When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit. Our project describes a system for the automation and monitoring of a smart house. An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
<p>A) Closed-circuit systems - In this system as long as your door is closed the electric circuit remains closed and whenever somebody opens the door, the circuit becomes discontinuous, and the alarm is set off.
