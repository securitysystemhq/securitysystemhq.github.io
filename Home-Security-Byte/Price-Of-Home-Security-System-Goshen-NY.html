<h3>Choosing the Best Security System For Your Home in Goshen</h3>
<p>Stay connected to home and enhance the security of your property with smarter video. IP cameras resolution is measured in digital megapixels instead of TV Lines (TVL) as traditional analog cameras do.

<p>On the other hand, DIY home security systems are perfect for those who don't mind rolling up their sleeves and performing some light troubleshooting if needed. Designed for unique purposes and scenarios, Hikvision's Special Series is integral to reliable network video solutions that require more than standard network cameras can offer. If you choose not to add another monthly fee to the mix, you may be disappointed with what the Nest Cam Outdoor can (and can't) do. It still delivers live video and alerts you when it detects sound or motion, but it stores those alerts for only up to three hours—and it gives just a snapshot of the action that triggered them.</p>
<p>However, the supplied 10-foot power cord limits placement and isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a Nest), and notifications that distinguish between people and general motion will cost you an additional $10 per month. You should also make sure that your local police department accepts the burglar alarm.

If video is part of your monitoring package, it can be a huge advantage in the event of a break-in because the monitoring company can report visual confirmation of the activity directly to the police to expedite the dispatching of personnel.</p>
