<p>When designing your home security system the most important thing to take into consideration is; "Do you want to stop the bad guy on the inside of your home or the outside?" It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>We are going to focus on cameras that can be placed in the home for surveillance. The following regulatory documents apply to the fire alarm system as opposed to individual smoke alarms of the residential type, even when they are AC powered and used for group operation. An inexperienced salesmen that doesn't know how to design a security system and thinks a security system only takes 3 doors and a motion sensor because that is how it comes packaged.</p>
<p>The CCTV cameras are used to support the security systems and also provide the video coverage of security alarms for barriers, intrusion detection and access control. SimpliSafe cameras work as standalone devices. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, but the compatibility question extends well beyond that distinction. Home monitoring sensors have a number of applications in your overall home security.</p>

<p>The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future. Additionally, what could be controlled through a smart phone app and whether there were false alarms and fast response times were deemed important as well.</p>
<p>I will focused on standard CCTV monitor, standalone DVR recorder and distribution power supply, as this is the most popular and likely solution for most CCTV installations. Look for models with multiple sensors - motion and heat for instance - that helps to reduce the number of false alerts. A typical fire alarm system has numerous initiating devices divided among separate zones — each connected via an initiating device circuit to a central control panel.</p>
