<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Wireless Security Cameras in Waterloo NY 13165</h3>
<p>There are two types of cameras used for surveillance - analog and IP (internet protocol), which are digital cameras. IP camera, is a kind of computerized camcorder usually utilized for reconnaissance and which, is not like simple shut circuit TV (CCTV) cameras, can send and get information by means of a PC network and the Internet.

Another object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric detection system which is selfcompensating in that changes of ambient light, such as daylight or artificial illumination, will not cause the system to give an alarm and which cannot be defeated by using a flash-light or some other form of light source.

For example, a smoke detector event will cause the alarm monitoring service to contact the fire department, while the signal from a medical alert pendant will be routed to ambulance or paramedic services. Not all smart security systems are a deterrent - it depends on the components you get and where you place them.</p>
