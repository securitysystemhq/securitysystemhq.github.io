If you can link all your smart home devices into a voice control unit, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home, then that's even better.</p>
<p>Motion sensing cameras can send an alert to your security company or your smartphone app when they are triggered, allowing you to get a feed just at the moment you need it, rather than all the time. A:Most companies do not give a lot of time when the alarm is first activated to when you personally disarm it.

Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control panel and run through a landline. But since DIY equipment is purchased upfront, most DIY home security providers don't require a lengthy contract for leasing equipment.</p>
