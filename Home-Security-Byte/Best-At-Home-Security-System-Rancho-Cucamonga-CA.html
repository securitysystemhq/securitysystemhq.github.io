<p>Wireless internet CCTV cameras, also known as wireless IP cameras, are the digital replacement for traditional analogue CCTV. From video collection only, to multi-dimensional data awareness: A Huawei Software Defined Camera (SDC) — with a full hardware series available, designed for diverse scenarios — converges cloud IoT data with media and information networks, to realize 360° awareness of people, vehicles, objects, the environment, and behaviors, mining multi-dimensional data for true value, and promising to comprehensively safeguard cities.</p>
<p>Depending on the anticipated fire scenario, building and use type, number and type of occupants, and criticality of contents and mission, these systems can provide several main functions. Arm and disarm your home security system, view live video feeds, lock or unlock your doors, and even adjust your smart thermostat directly from your phone.

<p>Service Providers can give their customer, the homeowner, the power to monitor and control many devices in the home: Thermostats, door locks, lighting, cameras - while at home or away. Intelligent intrusion detection is a delicate balance between responding to real security breaches and ignoring costly false alarm sources.

Wireless technology and home automation features have beefed up the strength of home security, while granting customers unprecedented control and customizability over their equipment.

It all starts with ensuring your systems meets the outcomes expected of it, and ensuring your expectation are met, or set, to what a systems is capable of today's fast moving world of technology its important that the correct technology is applied in all areas of business and CCTV is no exception.</p>
