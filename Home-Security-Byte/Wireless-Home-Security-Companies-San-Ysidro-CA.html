We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather.</p>

Other home security components include motion sensors, keypads, key fobs, cameras, glass-break sensors, and panic buttons. Professional installation is available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. CCTV camera systems need a power source in order to function.
