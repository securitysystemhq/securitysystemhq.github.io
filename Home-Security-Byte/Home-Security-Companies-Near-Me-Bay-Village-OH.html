<p>The two devices strengthen an already compelling smart home security platform. Have your alarm system serviced regularly (at least once a year) and change the batteries in your sensors as soon as they start to get low, as this can be a common cause of alarm systems malfunctioning. No, we have security systems that use wireless, cellular technology. Digital CCTV cameras are generally equipped with an Internet Protocol (IP) Address.</p>
<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
