<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>We are looking at the global market for Smart Edge IP Cameras and Video Analytics such as facial recognition and various video metadata forensic search. Storage may be limited compared to the 500GB+ DVRs that come with most wired camera systems. It all depends on the type of burglar alarm you have installed into your home. All images and video clips recorded with a Vivint surveillance system are automatically transferred via your home's Wi-Fi network to Vivint Smart Drive cloud storage.</p>
<p>The development of web-based systems from the evolution of the new APIs, and from the new languages based on the web 2.0 generation are also bringing improvements for intruder alarm systems. Bottom Line: The LifeShield Smart Home Security Kit is a versatile security system with home automation capabilities and the option to monitor professionally or on your own. For smaller and more specific needs, Home Controls provides several stand-alone and specialty security systems, including do-it-yourself (DIY) alert systems, wired and wireless driveway alarms, environmental reporting systems, security lighting and more.</p>
