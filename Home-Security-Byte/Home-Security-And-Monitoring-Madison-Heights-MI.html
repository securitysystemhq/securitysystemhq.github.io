They can perform all the functions of a digital video recorder mentioned above and adds support for IP and megapixel cameras. Our systems offer alarm verification to reduce or eliminate false alarms and can include regular inspection, maintenance, and support services. Fire safety begins with fire detection, and fire detection means everything from components—sensors, initiating devices, annunciators, and control panels—to integrated systems.</p>
<p>In some workplaces, such as those providing sleeping accommodation or care facilities, automatic fire detection and a high degree of structural protection are essential in ensuring a satisfactory standard of fire safety. In fact, I can't recall one time in my life when, exiting a building on a fire alarm, there was an actual fire.
