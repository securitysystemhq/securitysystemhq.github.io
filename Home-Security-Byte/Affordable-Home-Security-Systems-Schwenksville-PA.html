Another object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric detection system which is selfcompensating in that changes of ambient light, such as daylight or artificial illumination, will not cause the system to give an alarm and which cannot be defeated by using a flash-light or some other form of light source. The San Diego Police Department hoped to gain access to footage from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego‚Äù surveillance program As of 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility problems, and officers had difficulty viewing footage in real time because the department's police cruisers did not have a 4G connection.</p>
