<p>Fire and smoke alarms should be a standard feature in every home. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter. The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras. The CCTV cameras are enabled with analog or digital transmission of signals.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning.
