Cloud based storage is another option, which means you don't need to deal with equipment; the video is uploaded directly to the cloud.</p>

The most basic burglar alarm works with a simple electric circuit built into an entry door or window. We have a 'model city program' in a foreign country (AFRICA) that will have 5G Communication Technology and it will need a variety of Wireless Video surveillance solutions from transportation, plate identification, government, campus video surveillance, schools, and business parks and banking institutions surveillance, commercial applications, as well as residential neighborhoods.</p>
