<p>These cameras may seem like overkill to some but they can give you the peace of mind that someone at home is safe and sound while you are at work or on a business trip so that you can focus on the things you need to instead of worrying. If your building offers security, you might not need your own video surveillance system. Security cameras are a great start to securing your home. Activation of any manual pull station, initiating device, or water flow through the sprinkler system will activate all interior alarm notification appliances.</p>

<p>Internet-enabled security cameras are about as secure as a 2-tonne rhino behind a chain-link fence.

It is clear that the direction the video security industry is taking is the integration of the video security function with digital computing technology and the other parts of the security system: access control, intrusion alarms, fire, and two-way communications.</p>
