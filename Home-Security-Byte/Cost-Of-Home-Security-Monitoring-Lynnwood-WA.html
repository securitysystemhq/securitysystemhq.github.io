<p>Whether you have a photoelectric alarm or an ionization detector, regular cleaning will keep your smoke alarm in working order.

A CCTV unit will need to be installed by a professional, but if you own a very large property then the cost is definitely worth it. They can be placed both externally and internally and the DVR playback is easy and straightforward.</p>
