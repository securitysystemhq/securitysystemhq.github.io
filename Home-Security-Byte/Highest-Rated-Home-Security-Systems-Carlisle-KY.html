<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>DC Power Splitter - 1 to 2 Y Cable This DC Power Adapter Y Cable Pigtail splits 1 power signal into 2 and is useful for powering multiple cameras from one central adapter.

It allows users to remotely store, manage, record, play, and monitor surveillance footage entirely on the cloud or on secure servers.</p>
