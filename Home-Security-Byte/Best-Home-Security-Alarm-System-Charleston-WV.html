Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Remote monitoring and control (M&C) systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as factories, power plants, network operations centers, airports, and spacecraft, with some degree of automation. That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. Professionally installed systems take the trouble out of things for homeowners who don't have the time or expertise to set up all the sensors and accessories themselves.</p>

As shown in Figure 7 , the intelligent smoke alarm system consists of a smoke detection module, wireless communication module, and intelligent identification and data visualization module. Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>

Disadvantages: expensive, short zones which mean more electronics (and thus a higher cost), and a high rate of false alarms as it cannot distinguish some pets from humans.</p>
<p>This type of burglar alarm system is of cord-type, and it is limited for small distances due to usage of cables. If a genuine smoke or fire condition exists, the detector will reenter the alarm mode immediately after the reset attempt.
