However, effective monitoring is critical for the protection of subjects and the integrity of the data produced, but where on-site monitoring was once a requirement by regulatory bodies for critical study parameters, there is now an acceptance to move away from 100% SDV , as regulatory bodies understand that sponsors need to look for efficiencies in the cost of drug development, and research shows 100% SDV fails to pick up all issues.</p>
<p>DC Power Splitter - 1 to 2 Y Cable This DC Power Adapter Y Cable Pigtail splits 1 power signal into 2 and is useful for powering multiple cameras from one central adapter.
