CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes. Forecasting and Post-Event Investigations: The usefulness of surveillance technology in preventing and solving crimes depends on the resources put into it. The most effective systems are those which are monitored by trained staff, have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress, and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>The engineer and fire alarm technicians - as part of making the fire alarm design - will review the specifications on each property and determine where the fire alarms should go to maximize their efficiency and allow for the greatest safety assurances. As for burglar alarm systems, you can find systems that are dedicated to a particular purpose only.

Smoke and fire detectors that aren't wired directly into your alarm system cannot summon emergency personnel.</p>
<p>However, the supplied 10-foot power cord limits placement and isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a Nest), and notifications that distinguish between people and general motion will cost you an additional $10 per month.
