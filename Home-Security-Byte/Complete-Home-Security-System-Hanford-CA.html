Surveillance systems are readily being used by governments for crime prevention and investigation, in intelligence gathering, and to protect people, objects, processes, etc. This is important because several videos reportedly taken from the campus CCTV footage have been circulating in the last few days, which show the police beating students inside the library and also breaking CCTV cameras.</p>
<p>Advanced motion sensors include reliance on photo-sensory detection (say, a burglar walking into a beam of light from a light sensor source and breaks the path of the beam to trigger the alarm). With Project Green Light, businesses can purchase CCTV cameras and connect them to police headquarters.

What's even better is that you no longer need a complicated setup of monitoring cameras, as most modern security systems are unobtrusive, easy to install and use, and even stylish. Intruder alarm distributed decentralized networks are indeed a new paradigm for the supervision and control of the security systems.</p>
<p>The greatest sales point of the major home security systems is off site monitoring.

<p>Bullet cameras are long and cylindrical in shape and are ideal for outdoor use. The outdoor security cameras come in many models. Most of the in-home monitoring systems, proposed in the literature, focus on monitoring a set of specific vital signs.

<p>Be it a video intercom system or video door phone, they bring optimum security to your home, especially if there are kids at home or work from home alone. If smoke becomes present in the sample, it is detected and an alarm signal is transmitted to the main fire alarm control panel.
