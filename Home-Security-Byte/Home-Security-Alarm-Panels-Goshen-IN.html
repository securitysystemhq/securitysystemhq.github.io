<p>The Fire Prevention Division is a group of firefighters who are the ones that go around to buildings and do a fire alarm inspection and other kinds of building checks. In the event that you are away, the home security monitoring company can organize to dispatch an alarm response guard and organize to have any break and enter damage to your property repaired immediately.
