<p>Without a doubt, a major concern among citizens is the ability to keep their home safe and secure. Pressure pads are fitted under carpels (in front of the hi-fi or under one of the steps of the stairs) and will cause the alarm to sound when trodÂ¬den on.

When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors).
