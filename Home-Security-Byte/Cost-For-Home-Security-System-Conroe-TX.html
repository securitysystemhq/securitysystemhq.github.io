<p>CCTV Cameras come in a variety of shapes and sizes. I am so glad that you have mentioned about smart home integration Just last week I was given bunch of cameras to install by a home owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems.

Once inside, the circuit system is not effective anymore since it is not practical to set up circuits in every inch of the house.</p>

Choose from a wide range of Works with SmartThings devices, including lights, cameras, doorbells, door locks, thermostats, sensors, and more.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly detect motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.
