<p>Hidden cameras and spy cameras are becoming increasingly popular for use in home security. Major players in the home security system market are ADT (US), Honeywell (US), Johnson Controls (US), HANGZHOU HIKVISION DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY (China), ASSA ABLOY (Sweden), SECOM (Japan), Robert Bosch (Germany), United Technologies (US), Godrej & Boyce (India), (US), Allegion (Republic of Ireland), Control4 (US), Schneider Electric (France), Legrand (France), ABB (Switzerland), Comcast (US), STANLEY Convergent Security Solutions (US), Nortek Security & Control (US), FRONTPOINT (US), and Vivint (US).</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions.

<p>That competition has nudged third-party operators to step up their technology to the point where their technology and training can stack up against just about any in-house monitoring service. Manufacturers offer different types of cameras like fixed camera, bullet camera, dome camera, infrared camera, wireless security camera, spy camera and more. This is outdoor security camera does more than the usual surveillance duties - it has people, car and animal detection, allowing it to report in real-time if someone is found loitering around your home, if a car enters your driveway or if your pet is in the yard.</p>
