<p>We are leading experts in fire alarm systems and test equipment. Your system will include basic door and window alarm sensors, and may include motion detectors.

For example, if a client claims to have purchased an expensive item but does not have the receipt, video surveillance records are used to determine whether she was in the store on the day in question, and if she did purchase the item.</p>
<p>The small size and ease of deployment of many video components and the flexibility in transmission means over short and long distances has made rapid deployment equipment for portable personnel protection systems practical and important. They also don't need to worry about creating a detailed sketch of the facility, showing exact camera type, placement, and field of view for an installer, and then ensuring that the cameras spec'd are placed in the locations intended, - heck, the salesman might even have to visit the site during installation if he specs different types of cameras in different places.</p>
