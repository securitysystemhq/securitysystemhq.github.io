<p>Have you ever noticed that your fire alarm or your smoke alarm goes off every time you cook? We constantly push the boundaries of technology to develop intelligent solutions that go beyond the highest security demands of today and deliver clear business advantages beyond security.

Professional monitoring gives you peace of mind during an alarm, no matter where you are. Add sensors using your phone's camera by scanning the QR code present behind the sensor.

<p>Link Interactive combines the best of time-tested security solutions with modern technology and equipment. While this is called a medical alert device, it can also be used as a personal protection device because it uses GPS tracking and a connection to a monitoring center to locate and communicate with anyone who's wearing one. When our code-compliant alarm systems detect fires, they will not only alert authorities, but also activate the building's life safety evacuation and communications systems.</p>
