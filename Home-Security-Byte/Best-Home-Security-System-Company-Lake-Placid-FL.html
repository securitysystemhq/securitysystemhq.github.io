<p>Surveillance plays a huge part in today's society, and with cameras all around us, our day-to-day lives are experiencing higher levels of security each day. Your job is not done, however, after you buy and install smoke detectors. It is during the testing of your alarm system you will see if any problems have occurred in relation to the burglar alarm battery.

And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger. If you choose a DIY wireless security system, most on the market today are fairly intuitive and easy to install.
