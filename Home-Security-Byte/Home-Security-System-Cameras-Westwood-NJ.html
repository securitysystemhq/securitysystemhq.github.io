<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Depending on the anticipated fire scenario, building and use type, number and type of occupants, and criticality of contents and mission, these systems can provide several main functions. Arm and disarm your home security system, view live video feeds, lock or unlock your doors, and even adjust your smart thermostat directly from your phone. ADT (US), Moni (US), Honeywell (US), Securitas (Sweden), UTC (US), Schneider (France), Johnson Controls (US), Vivint (US), Vector Security (US), and Bosch (Germany) are some of the major companies dominating the alarm monitoring market.</p>
<p>These camera are developed with the help of excellent quality raw materials and sophisticated technology, in compliance with set industrial norms. Be alerted to movement within or around your home by motion detectors when your security system is armed. Addressable panels are usually much more advanced than their conventional counterparts, with a higher degree of programming flexibility and single point detection.</p>

<p>Detectors might be sited in other areas of the building, but the objective is to protect the escape route. These are the two types of alarm systems. However, some of the security camera systems installed by government security agencies are more complex, and take more time to install. The panel will then activate one or more signaling circuits to sound building alarms and summon emergency help. To further complicate the situation, there are many local security dealers that do not advertise the brand name that will be doing the monitoring.</p>
<p>So the alarm vendors have reacted to the queries and qualms of pet owners about the problem of pets setting off a false alarm, and designed burglar-alarm that take pets into consideration. If hallways are longer than 40 feet between the sleeping and living areas, use two smoke detectors. Generally, in this instance, a security company will oftentimes give you the equipment for free and provide you with a free installation.</p>

<p>Motion Detection: If you're concerned about video storage, check to see if the camera offers motion detection. However, the dome security camera type does have a fixed viewing angle like 100° just as the bullet cameras, instead of offering you a panoramic and distorted view. You can add indoor and outdoor cameras to any of our systems and integrate them with your home's Wi-Fi so you can access live image capture and video streaming.</p>
<p>Alerts: A good outdoor security camera will alert your smartphone or tablet whenever motion is detected. A very important application for any DVR system is the ability to monitor live and access to recordings through remote access. To prevent a clandestine attack using a secondary light source being used to hold the detector in a sealed condition whilst an intruder passes through, most systems use and detect a modulated light source.</p>
<p>While any smoke detector is better than none, there are a few things to look for when buying a new smoke alarm. Increased R&D in the field of remote monitoring, home automation systems, and Internet of Things, in terms of new and improved technologies, is a major factor driving market growth in North America. These cameras are connected to a monitoring and recording system through a secure wireless connection.</p>
<p>When your alarm is activated the security guards alarm monitoring screen will flash to advise that your home security has been breached. This is anticipated to be major reason for the expansion of the CCTV cameras market during the forecast period. A combination of smoke and heat detectors, sirens and bells, and strobe lights detect fires and alert building occupants, giving them ample time to evacuate in an orderly fashion.</p>
<h3>5 Reasons To Install a Video Security Camera System At Your Home in Westwood</h3>

The advantage of manual alarm stations is that, upon discovering the fire, they provide occupants with a readily identifiable means to activate the building fire alarm system.</p>

Sub Stream - a lower resolution stream used when viewing multiple cameras in a grid on the computer or mobile device.
