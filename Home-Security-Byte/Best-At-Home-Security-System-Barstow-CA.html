<p>In such cases, the only option remains is the burglar alarm systems; these alarm systems are electronic alarms designed to alert a user from unspecific danger. There are also systems that permit a duress code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery.

When it comes to home security systems, one of the benefits is the ability to watch the footage again later in the case of a break in.

CCTV cameras are limited to 4CIF, or 704 x 480, while IP cameras are well past to 3 megapixel, or 2048 x 1536.

These sensors are installed on entry points of the place and whenever any intruder try to trespass these entry points, the motion sensors senses motion activity in these points and the control box then gives a loud noise by which we come to know about the burglars activity.</p>
