It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

So unless you truly know what you're doing, you should probably opt for professional installation, especially if your new security system will need to be hardwired.</p>
<p>Some cameras may use default passwords - which you should always change - or be easy to hack. As you can guess, with alarm monitoring worth so much, many of the family run alarm companies cashed out long ago. Among the biggest decisions to make when deciding which home security company to choose is whether you want to install it yourself or have a professional do it. Some people love the idea that they can install the system themselves, while others are concerned about being able to do the installation correctly.</p>
