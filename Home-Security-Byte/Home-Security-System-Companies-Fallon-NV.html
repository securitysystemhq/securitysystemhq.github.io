<p>We use Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) for surveillance, security, property protection, monitoring employee performance and to monitor areas that may be deemed unsafe for human habitation. Frontpoint offers a competitive range of security equipment and monitoring services with the freedom of do-it-yourself installation and month-to-month contracts. Cameras are a smart addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the need for alarms and sensors. Also included are other fire alarm functions, such as guard's tour, sprinkler waterflow, sprinkler supervisory equipment, elevator capture and shutdown, door release, smoke doors and damper control, fire doors and fan shutdown — only where these functions are actually controlled by the fire alarm system.</p>
<p>Most DIY systems are easy to install and are sold as kits that you can configure to suit your specific needs. Pro Series Doorbells provide video intercom functionality, supporting communication with the master station and the indoor station. The mobile and IP communications have developed and completely changed the way we now use, monitor and control intruder security systems. After a certain number of false alarms, the police won't respond to any call-outs.</p>
<p>Detection devices run the gamut, from smoke detectors and heat detectors to multi-capability detectors, which contain a number of functions in one detector. Most companies also offer yard signs and window decals to warn potential burglars that a house is protected by an alarm service. Alternatively, your building's security system could consist of nothing more than a couple bubble cameras that only monitor hallways and office entries.</p>

One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally. A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing.

<p>Thanks to our state-or-the-art home security systems, we are able to calibrate our equipment to better fit your needs. Many burglar alarm systems are monitored by a professional security company , which is automatically alerted when a burglar (or other disturbance) triggers the alarm. This is just a receiver that sits in your house which is connected to motion sensors on the doors and windows. From having a new video encoding technology, your cameras keep the same pixel count and bit rate while using half the storage of H.264 encoding.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there are many innovative security features that can be incorporated into your alarm system to help keep your property as safe as possible. When it detects the door or the window moving, it then sends a signal to the central control center, which then sounds the alarm device to ward off the intruder.
