<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Alternatively, NVR cameras can save video images to their own internal storage using a microSD card. When a fire alarm occurs within a high-rise building, it is recommended practice to pressurize the fire stairwells so that smoke cannot infiltrate the stairs while the occupants are using them to exit.

An unauthorized intruder can defeat this system by passing through the field of the detector very slowly whereby the condenser never charges to the point where the amplifier will operate and consequently no alarm results.</p>
