<p>When choosing a video surveillance system, you want to go with the best video quality for the buck, and with a Network IP camera, there are 10 reasons why you should consider them over 20th century CCTV cameras. However, in general, professionally installed systems cost more, and you usually have to also sign up for a monitoring plan. Dome cameras are typically used for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The central module connects at the Internet via WiFi and through an application we can remotely monitor the state of the house or control various devices within the enclosure.

Whether you have one camera or several, they work with your home's internet network to send footage right to your computer or mobile device.

The ADT Home Security Starter Kit (pictured left) includes an ADT Security Hub, two ADT Door and Window Detectors, and an ADT Motion Detector.</p>
<p>These cameras share the images across the internet, so CCTV footage can be easily accessed. If you are looking for a full proof security system to protect your house, you can use the combination of the motion detectors and open or closed circuit alarms. It's never an easy task to evacuate people from really large buildings, even with the latest in fire alarm design. If you are concerned that an audible deterrent is not merely enough security for your needs then monitored security systems provide added assurance and peace of mind that someone is monitoring your home 24 hours a day and should your alarm be triggered, help will be on its way.</p>
