<p>A system that uses video cameras to feed images to monitors in a centralised control room is known as a closed circuit television or CCTV. 2. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, photo-electric means arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage and a chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the output of said means is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said means to have varying voltage, an amplifier connected to said electrical means and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>Some models have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to review footage, but this is a rare feature. We deal in IP CCTV, CCTV Cameras installations, Biometric systems, Fire Detection Systems which are easy to operate, highly sensitive and offer high performance.

The sound activated burglar alarm circuit was constructed in accordance with the circuit designed as illustrated Figure 4. The design was simulated on electronics work bench 11. The testing followed the modular pattern used in the design with each functional block being tested as described as follows.</p>

<p>Other parts of the system to be checked will include the batteries to ensure they are fully charged and not worn; the smoke and heat detectors to make sure they are fully sensitive and the bells or sounders to ensure they are suitably audible in all parts of the premises. The demand for IP video surveillance systems is high in the commercial vertical owing to the increased awareness about the advantages offered by IP video surveillance systems over analog systems.</p>
