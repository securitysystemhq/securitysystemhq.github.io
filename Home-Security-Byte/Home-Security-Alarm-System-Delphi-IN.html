<p>The greatest degree of home security is often achieved through utilizing a combination of products. Earlier surveillance systems had a lot of dependence on human operators, it is lately that automated systems are being preferred because of their better efficiencies and reliability 1 It has been seen that surveillance with full human operators' involvement has certain inadequacies like the high cost of labor, variations in long-duration capturing and limited ability for multi-screen monitoring 2 Traditional surveillance systems are being complemented and even replaced by the advanced intelligent surveillance systems (AISS), as the latter is used in identifying abnormal behavior and patterns in videos by developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision.</p>
<p>These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors , and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations. Ring also offers other home security products like an Alarm Flood & Freeze Sensor, Panic Alarm, and a Smoke and CO Listener, while exterior security can be boosted with the company's new range of smart lights While you will pay a small monthly fee ($10) for professional monitoring, the Ring Alarm Security Kit is the perfect choice for value hunters.</p>
