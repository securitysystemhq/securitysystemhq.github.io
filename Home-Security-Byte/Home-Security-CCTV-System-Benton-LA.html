Indoor cameras can be part of a complete home security system, or used on their own to add extra protection to your home and your loved ones.

The most popular fixed temperature detectors used in homes are preset to sound an alarm when the temperature exceeds 135 degrees F. Other units are available to be preset up to temperatures of approximately 200 to 225 degrees F. These detectors may be used in an attic where summer temperatures normally may reach 135 degrees F.</p>
