Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, casinos, airports, military installations, and convenience stores.</p>
<p>Since IP cameras have a wider field of vision, as well, an IP system can often work with fewer less cameras than an analog system. Take it to the next level with IFTTT recipes to automate with other smart home compatible devices. Easy re-installation - If you need to reposition sensors or cameras, it's easy.
