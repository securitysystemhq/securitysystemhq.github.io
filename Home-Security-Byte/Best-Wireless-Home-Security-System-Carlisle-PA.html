This camera performs very similarly to the Nest Cam Outdoor, with the capability to deliver crystal-clear 1080p images day and night and with two-way communication so you can hear and talk to whoever is in front of the camera.</p>

Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>
