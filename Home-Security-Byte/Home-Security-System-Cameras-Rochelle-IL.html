Axis EN and MxPro 5 fire panels from global systems leader, Advanced, have been certified by FM Approvals to the EN 54 standard, becoming the first UK-manufactured fire alarm control panels to attain this accreditation. Unless you have a UPS or power backup the cameras and recorder will also be powered off if there is no electricity.</p>
<p>With the help of a digital video surveillance camera, you can and take immediate action even before the event occurs. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously. In these systems, the monitor to be viewed will often be automatically shifted to a larger screen and will activate recording equipment.</p>
<p>Other high-tech devices you might find worth the cost are personal alarm systems, which provide you with immediate access to emergency personnel, as well as security cameras that can be linked to your smartphone.
