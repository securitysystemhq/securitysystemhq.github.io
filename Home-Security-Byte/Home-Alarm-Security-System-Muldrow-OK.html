<p>It's hard to know just how important the right fire safety equipment will be unless you've been through a fire and have already experienced it. The fact is that the proper equipment can save lives. In reality it does not work that well, as extreme weather may often cause false alarms. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm.

The monitoring company has guards watching the screens 24 hours a day just waiting to receive an alarm distress call. There's also a smartphone app and smart home compatibility built-in as well as optional monitoring from ADT and cellular backup.
