<p>Is there any place in your plant which is not suitable for a person to stay there to monitor important process? There are things working in it that tell it there is a fire, so called alarm initiating devices, things that let people who use it know there is a fire, the so called alarm notification appliances, things that it uses to try to prevent the spread of fire, the so called fire control units, and all the infrastructure that holds these three things together, all the electricity and wires that runs throughout the whole affair.</p>
