<p>The company wanted to create a comprehensive security device without using wi-fi-connected cameras, which are controversial but increasingly common thanks to product families like the Google-owned Nest and Amazon's Ring. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and same app as the original Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing area), better audio, a stronger mount, and a wider operating temperature range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>For the most trouble-free installation and the best in security, purchasing video surveillance systems from home security companies has distinctive benefits. In a fire alarm system there is always a smoke detector to detect smoke or fire. Currently, no DIY home security systems work with HomeKit, but if you're a Google Home owner, you may prefer to choose one of our other picks.

<p>Common exceptions to this rule are video surveillance systems used in patient care areas or for patient monitoring. Basically, this allows your Nest Cam IQ device to shoot videos with multiple exposures, then digitally combine the images to create a more true-to-life video. To fully secure your business and the safety of your employees, you may want to also look at access control, monitored alarm systems and fire alarms.</p>
