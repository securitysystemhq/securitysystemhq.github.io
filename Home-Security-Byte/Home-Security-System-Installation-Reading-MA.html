<p>CCTV camera security systems are the popular equipments used for security purposes now days. That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>The Firex is easy to install and can be interconnected with other alarms to create a full-house smoke detection system.

Activation of a burglar alarm circuit is made when the switch detects the opening or closing of the circuit, for example opening a door or window.</p>
