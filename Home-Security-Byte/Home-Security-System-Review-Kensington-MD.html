<p>Remote monitoring and control (M&C) systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as factories, power plants, network operations centers, airports, and spacecraft, with some degree of automation.

A typical example would be to have multiple buildings of a facility have their own panels, which could detect input signals from specific smoke detectors or other signaling device.</p>
<p>You can also ramp up your security level with more sophisticated add-ons such as a closed-circuit camera system for full monitoring inside your home and out. As the crime rate is increasing day by day and burglars are becoming smarter by every passing day, the security system for commercial setups likebanks, shops and houses need to be fool proof.
