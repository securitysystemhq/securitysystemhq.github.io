<p>Unlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security.

<p>If the door or a window was opened and the electric circuit closed, the sudden flow of current caused one of the attached magnets in the system to vibrate. Other output functions include shutting down electrical equipment such as computers, shutting off air handling fans to prevent smoke migration, and shutting down operations such as chemical movement through piping in the alarmed area.
