<h4>Wireless Security System Thompsons Station 37179</h4>
<p>Unlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security. When one unit senses smoke, all interconnected detectors will switch their relays; only the detector sensing smoke will go into alarm, thus pinpointing the fre source.

<p>If the door or a window was opened and the electric circuit closed, the sudden flow of current caused one of the attached magnets in the system to vibrate. Other output functions include shutting down electrical equipment such as computers, shutting off air handling fans to prevent smoke migration, and shutting down operations such as chemical movement through piping in the alarmed area. Dome security cameras are an excellent choice for home coverage.</p>
