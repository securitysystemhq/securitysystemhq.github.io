Use motion-based retention and scheduled recording to customize video storage plans for every deployment.</p>
<p>If communication with one home monitoring center is interrupted, the other centers takes over quickly, giving them the ability to offer continuous security through the company's advanced alarm monitoring service - providing clients with increased safety and peace of mind.
