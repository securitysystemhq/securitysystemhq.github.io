<p>Many people share a grave misconception about the use and application of fire alarm systems. This security camera is pretty generic and provides a decent quality of about 720p resolution.

Today, many wireless security systems are included as part of special packages that also provide many of the important sensors that will be ultimately integrated with the system.</p>
