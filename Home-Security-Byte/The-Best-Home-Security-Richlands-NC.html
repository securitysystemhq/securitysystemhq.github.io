<p>When walking along the corridors of hospitals, schools, or office buildings, have you ever noticed those small red boxes mounted on the corridor walls, usually near the fire exits? The basic configuration of an average home security alarm system consists of a control panel, siren and sensors.

<p>If properly utilized, remote monitoring services can act as useful IT management tools at a fraction of the maintenance cost.

But if you have an alarm, get into the habit of using it every time you leave the house.</p>
<p>Video: Big security operation centers where a lot of cameras must be examined or scrutinized, video wall viewing is generally preferred. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. Monitored home security systems cost between $20 and $60 per month.
