<p>Experts believe that CCTV discourages opportunistic crime, where an offender spontaneously takes advantage of a situation. Using the IP protocol for the net support and Html as the language for the web-servers, it is created the possibility to support several hardware technologies on the same physical net implementation, and also, no less important, created the capability to use and connect to the network systems from different suppliers and technologies, which will give an huge flexibility, not only with the net topology but also at the built grids (individual alarm systems), improving the adaptation capabilities.</p>
<p>Vivint wireless security camera systems can be outfitted with motion sensor technology that is both energy-efficient and more secure. Presently, sophisticated burglar alarm ranging from miniature, self-contained noisemakers, to intricate, multi-zoned systems having color-coded computer monitor outputs are available. They receive a signal from a fire sensor (smoke, heat or carbon monoxide detector) and automatically transmit it to the fire alarm panel.</p>

While prior systems were only able to notify the user of a fire in a generalized zone, the functionality of addressable control panels were now able to pinpoint which individual or multiple signaling devices have been activated, such as a pull station or smoke detector. This would include a wide set of options such as sirens, sensors, magnetic switches, ultrasonic detectors, microwave detectors and security cameras.</p>
<p>These devices, installed e.g. in the security building, provide access to all functions of the system and its current status data. Managers and supervisors can use video surveillance to monitor employee productivity, determine job performance areas where the employee needs improvement and insure that employees follow company safety rules. In or near attics, bathrooms, inside air ducts, unheated buildings, unheated motor homes, because temperatures may exceed typical limits of 32 to 100 degrees F.</p>
