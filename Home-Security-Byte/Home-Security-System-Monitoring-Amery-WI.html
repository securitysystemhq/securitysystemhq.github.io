However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>

Some devices can only be controlled by a remote control whilst others can be controlled in multiple ways: a physical switch on the device itself, a remote control, and a smartphone or any web-enabled device.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, cameras are only one a player in the general surveillance system, and regardless of whether an ever-increasing number of cameras and video encoders are incorporated, progressed and complex picture examination is still performed on the backend, regularly using cloud-based preparing administrations. These cameras can pick up coloured images in very low-light conditions.
