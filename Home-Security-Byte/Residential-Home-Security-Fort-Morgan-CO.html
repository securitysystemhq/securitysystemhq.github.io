The rising deployment of IP and Power over Ethernet (PoE)- based network devices provides a number of ways for cyberattacks, thereby causing cybersecurity threats. Various sensors like Motion sensor, flame detector and touch sensor are interfaced to the system. When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed.</p>
<p>However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarmâ€”if they respond at all. Thermal cameras can also capture video of a person's movements based on body temperature. Fire alarm systems have control panels, which are the brain off the fire alarm system, the control panel would be the main connection between your fire alarm system and the primary station.</p>
