<p>As the years progressed, burglar alarms progressed right along with them.

Some cameras even record videos and images and store them in a digital storage device such as a DVR. Such systems also come with a remote that is much like the remote control you use in your car alarm. Therefore, detectors will be placed in escape routes, although this may not be suitable depending on the risk assessment or if the size and complexity of a building are increased.</p>
