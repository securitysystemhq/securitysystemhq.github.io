<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Unlike analog systems, IP security cameras have become the mainstream in the security industry by much clearer images, easy remote access, flexible installation and affordable prices, offering you superior protection, convenience and peace of mind. These systems can range from wireless home security cameras to sophisticated alarm systems that notify law enforcement at the first sign of trouble. Depending on the security system you choose, that may or may not include motion detector alerts, outside security camera alerts, and life-saving alerts like notification that your smoke alarm went off.</p>
<p>Home security cameras are a crucial investment in protecting your home. In addition to providing more comprehensive protection, complete home security systems that are backed by professional monitoring services may also qualify customers for discounted homeowner's insurance premiums of up to 20 percent.

<p>The surveillance cameras did nothing to help the man. SD Card - many IP cameras come with SD card storage and the main video footage stored is when there are motions detected.
