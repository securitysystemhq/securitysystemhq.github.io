<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

Nowadays, house alarms or home security systems are preferably needed to ensure the house security from burglars and criminals. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service — which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups — is also expensive if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Costing less than a single smart camera, this starter kit contains a Smart Hub KX-HNB600, Indoor Siren KX-HNS105, Motion Sensor KX-HNS102 and Door & Window sensor KX-HNS101. These safety alarms are featured as electronic devices that have sensors.
