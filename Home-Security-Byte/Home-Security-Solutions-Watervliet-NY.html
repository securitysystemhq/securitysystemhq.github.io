<p>The importance of a properly installed fire alarm system is not to be overlooked. Along with high resolution images, Matrix IP cameras decrease storage costs by offering latest H.265 Compression technology. Finally, experts state that a home without an alarm system is three times more likely to be burglarized than a home with a professionally monitored system installed. With the latest smart home technology from your favourite security brands, deterring burglars and detecting trespassers has never been easier.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>This can help to prevent numerous false alarms that a smoke detector may produce. Analog camera systems are affordable and can be sufficient for remote monitoring depending on the application. TP-Link offers a robust outdoor camera with cloud storage for under $100. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app.</p>
