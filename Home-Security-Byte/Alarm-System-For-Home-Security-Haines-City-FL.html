Active and faster response - You may have the best home security measures in your house, but if the kind of security system you have fails to get quick response from the outside or from third party monitoring such as quick connection to fire departments, law enforcements and other authorities, your system is useless and may need some major overhaul, or if not, a complete replacement.</p>
<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>
