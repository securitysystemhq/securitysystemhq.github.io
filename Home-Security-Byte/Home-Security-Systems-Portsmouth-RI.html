For Home Owners: CCTV Security cameras help the owners to constantly monitor the activities going on in their home. C-mount cameras can cover distances beyond 40 ft thanks to the possibility to use special lenses with these cameras, whereas standard CCTV lenses can only cover distances of 35-40 ft. It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing.</p>
<p>Institutions that involve monetary exchange like banks and casinos as well as public areas where many people congregate such as at airports, terminals and malls, are often secured by surveillance camera systems.

Smart fire alarm systems can perform integrated automatic actions, for example, discharge fire-suppression systems in closed designated areas; and vary the notifications to support people on their way out, while protecting expensive electronic equipment inside.
