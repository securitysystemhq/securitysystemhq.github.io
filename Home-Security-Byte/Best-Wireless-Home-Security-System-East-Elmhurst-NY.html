<h3>Easy Remote Viewing of a Home Security Video Surveillance Alarm in East Elmhurst</h3>
<p>Numerous studies show homes without security systems, when compared to those with professionally monitored systems, are up to three times more likely to be burglarized because burglars are opportunistic by nature and are on the hunt for easy targets. Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, casinos, airports, military installations, and convenience stores.</p>
<p>As well as sounding an alarm, such sensors can easily be a part of a burglar alarm with text or phone alerts. Availability of low cost cameras and ease of installation are important factors for growth of DIY cameras. This means that no wiring is needed (except between detection devices and their transmitters) and that the control panel can be situated anywhere in the house and moved around if you want.

<p>A novel architecture places video storage on the camera, not in the cloud, ensuring mission critical network activities get the bandwidth they need.

This way one can implement a global security alarm strategy, allowing the network to detect a certain failure, either by a technical failure or a security violation of one of the individual intruder alarm systems.
