<p>Just like with any other electronic that you will own, fire alarms and smoke alarms do not last forever. Many people installing a home surveillance system will try to place the cameras high enough that they cannot be tampered with, but are so high the camera can only see the top of the intruder's head. Spy Cameras - these are covert cameras that record images or footage without being visible. Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. The modern fire alarm system is capable of detecting smoke and heat from a small flame, water flow in a sprinkler system or an activated pull station, and reporting this information to on-site personnel via dedicated phone line to any location in the world.</p>

<p>Like any product that connects to the internet and uses wireless technology, smart home security systems are vulnerable to hacking, particularly systems that lack encryption.
