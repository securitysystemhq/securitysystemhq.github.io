<p>There are some people who spend a lot of time and effort in purchasing their perfect home. 4. Solving Cases - Number 3 brings us here; if the cameras do not work as a crime deterrent, then the footage video surveillance systems capture can be used as evidence and help ensure that the proper arrests and prosecutions are made in case of a theft, vandalism or assault.

<p>IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it.
