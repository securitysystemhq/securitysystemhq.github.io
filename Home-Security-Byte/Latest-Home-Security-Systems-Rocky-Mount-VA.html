<p>As the founder of a Security Systems Equipment Company, I am continuously baffled as to why so many homeowners, (and for that matter business owners), spend the money to install a Security System with central monitoring, but don't include smoke and fire sensors. 4. Smart Cameras: CCTV cameras are dumb; they just send video to a DVR. Surveillance cameras are usually placed in shopping malls, work places, and banks. To qualify for both fire and burglary alarm discounts from Kin, we require a certificate of alarm that states you have a security alarm that is monitored off site. Strictly a local alert system, it does not dial out to any emergency phone number but provides both a visual and audio alarm whenever sensors are triggered to warn anyone in the home.</p>
<p>Wireless alarms look nicer but are more expensive. Footage is also often recorded at a lower resolution than wired cameras, making it more difficult to identify people in recordings. It also offered a pledge of commitment to security and released a fleet of updated equipment to settle customer worries and instill greater confidence in their services. A security camera DVR can operate remotely, it is able to detect movement and it has an internal memory that saves captured footage taken over a long period of time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR. Video walls offer a very big screen so that many people can watch the captured videos from a number of cameras at the same time. This will give you the choice of watching the videos from these cameras live or at another time.</p>
