However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>

<p>DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well. There are tons of commercial security camera systems on the market, but our overall favorite is the robust Frontpoint system, which you can mix and match with other security system devices. Disadvantages: extremely sensitive to weather; as rain, snow, and fog, for example, would cause the sensors to stop working, and need sterile perimeter line because trees and bushes or anything that blocks the beam would cause false alarm or lack of detection.</p>

The company has developed a weatherproof smart security camera called Argus which is a WiFi enabled camera with a built-in motion sensor that triggers an alarm as soon as it detects any motion.

The advantage of conventional systems is that they are relatively simple for small to intermediate size buildings. The ADT Pulse monitoring service starts at $28.99 per month and requires a three-year contract, but you also have to figure in the cost of things like hardware components, cellular backup, and installation.</p>
<p>For example, a department store could use video surveillance cameras to track foot traffic so that they can position their merchandise in key zones. All you will need is a battery to power the circuit, a switch to install on the door frame, a magnet in the door and a buzzer or alarm to connect to the circuit.
