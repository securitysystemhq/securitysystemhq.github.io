<p>Today there's a lot more to a home security camera than video surveillance. In a remote monitoring approach, combined with Risk Based Monitoring , you are moving away from 100% SDV onsite. I've covered consumer electronics for more than 15 years and have tested scores of smart-home devices, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Wireless burglar alarms work similarly to wired ones, but the sensors communicate with the control panel via a radio frequency. Learn more about professional home security monitoring here.</p>
