Firstly, it is a lot cheaper than purchasing a professionally made home security video camera; you are looking at around $300+ for a good store purchased system, whereas you can make your own for less than $100.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this CCTV camera type is that dome cameras are rather deceptive on where they are looking at. You can never tell by looking at it in distance. One of the problems of having a burglar alarm system is setting it off accidentally. A self-contained or hidden camera with internal DVR can easily be moved from location to location and it records on a memory card for later viewing.
