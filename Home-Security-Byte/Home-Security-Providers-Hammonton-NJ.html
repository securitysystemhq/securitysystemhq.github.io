Your alarm system is composed of motion detectors, sensors for the doors and windows, a high decibel alarm, a control keypad and a battery backup in the event of a power failure.</p>
<p>If you really want to record the scene going on in the premises then you need to take the help of DVR (digital video recorder) systems. From this approach the "intelligence" capability of all the distributed net will be applied to react in a much more efficient way to the different alarm situations that can occur, being the alarm systems able to distinguish more accurately real security violations from, for example, unadvertedly operations, increasing security levels and also the immunity to technical failures.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. Choosing the right security system for your property and budget is no easy task - there's a broad range of systems available and you are entering into a world filled with technical jargon.

We believe that the future is to utilize the hidden potential and use 100% of the video security data.</p>
