<p>Dummy CCTV cameras have a lot of potentially attractive features but are they the answer to home or office security? Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>When setting up lighting for an indoor or outdoor surveillance camera, it's important to make sure that the light source is not within the camera's field of view. Burglar alarm system is an innovation which assumes the liability to ensure and secure your home as well as your property.

The best security cameras also offer a real-time view and are equipped with two-way audio to scare off intruders using your mobile device.

Whether you're on vacation or just at work, alarm systems can help ensure your home is protected even when no one is home.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR. Video walls offer a very big screen so that many people can watch the captured videos from a number of cameras at the same time. This will give you the choice of watching the videos from these cameras live or at another time.</p>

Local storage: Some cameras include memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can store video right on the device.

Active and faster response - You may have the best home security measures in your house, but if the kind of security system you have fails to get quick response from the outside or from third party monitoring such as quick connection to fire departments, law enforcements and other authorities, your system is useless and may need some major overhaul, or if not, a complete replacement.</p>
<p>Any potential intruders will see that you have an alarm system in place and are likely to move on to a more vulnerable property than yours.
