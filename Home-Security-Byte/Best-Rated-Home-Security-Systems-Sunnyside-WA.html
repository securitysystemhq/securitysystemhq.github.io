<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

In advanced systems, the control box will be connected to several different components and will typically activate a siren or loud alarm noise, a flashing outdoor light and siren and a telephone auto-dialer.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly detect motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.
