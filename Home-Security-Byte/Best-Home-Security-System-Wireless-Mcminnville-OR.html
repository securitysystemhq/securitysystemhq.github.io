<p>Burglar alarms were usually associated with stores or other businesses in the past, but over the past few years, more and more people chose to protect their homes with alarms as well. When installing wireless security cameras, keep in mind that the smart home camera you buy will only be as good as the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the location where you plan to install it. So before you drill holes in your walls or otherwise mess up your doorframe, brick or siding, check your Wi-Fi speed If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll notice significant lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other delays that make security cameras a pain to use.</p>
<p>Not all companies support wireless alarm systems, but the best and most reputable companies support the technology. Even though prices are on the higher end, years of experience combined with the most monitoring centers in the land assure ADT customers get fast response times and helpful service when they need it most. Sufficient evidence has shown that CCTV surveillance systems mostly discourage crimes and robberies, but not more vicious crimes such as aggravated assault and rape.</p>
<p>The ADT app makes controlling your home security simple and intuitive with our interface.

In addition to perimeter sensors, many systems also include motion detectors that monitor large areas inside the house. These surveillance systems may not always catch these crimes because they usually occur in more deserted places and far from the surveillance cameras' reach.</p>

Our outdoor security cameras have a weather rating of IP66.
