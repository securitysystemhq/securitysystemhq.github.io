Adiline Macriga, Smart Home Monitoring and Controlling System Using Android Phone, International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering, Website: (ISSN 2250-2459, ISO 9001:2008 Certified Journal, Volume 3, Issue 11, November 2013).</p>

In most cases, the installation process will begin with connecting the cameras either to their power source or to the network. The most common alarm systems use the principle of circuits: closed and open. These are LED bulbs fitted on the camera, and switch on automatically in low light conditions and allow the camera to see in the dark in black and white images.</p>
<p>The control panel performs supervisory functions over the initiating devices, indicating appliances, all associated field wiring, telephone ties, and its own internal wiring and circuit cards. Professional installation services may cost up to $250, although special offers that waive installation fees are common. However, if your camera has a narrow viewing angle but a wide pan tilt, you may be fine to scale back your number of cameras (as long as you frequently pan the cameras to take in every corner of the room).</p>
