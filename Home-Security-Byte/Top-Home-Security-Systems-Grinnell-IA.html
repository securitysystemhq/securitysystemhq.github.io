<p>Security bars, burglar bars and window bars are all terms used to describe a physical barrier installed over a window opening in order to discourage unauthorized entry by an unwanted party. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and dangers. When you think about how much equipment you'll need, you should also think about which home automation devices you want and which disaster-prevention devices you'll need (like smoke alarms, CO sensors, and flood sensors). Because a construction site is hardly an environment conducive for surveillance, the cameras being used should be weatherproof.</p>
<p>The wireless Minut alarm instead uses several sensors to track key risk-factors within the home. Your system can act as a hub for up to 119 smart home devices, and can be controlled via Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more.
