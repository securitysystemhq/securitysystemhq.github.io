Perhaps this is no better demonstrated than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had changed since he took on the role in 2014, with the growth of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and much more.</p>
