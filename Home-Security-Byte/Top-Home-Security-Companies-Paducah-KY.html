Conspicuously placed cameras have been proven to reduce threats of violence and vandalism at businesses dramatically. It uses Z-Wave enabled devices to make it easy for you to automate lights, locks, thermostats, and more—no matter which level of monitoring you select. The first signal sent by your control panel will alert monitoring personnel at the central station, who will call to notify you and confirm whether it's a real emergency or a false trigger.</p>
<p>For example, cameras can be set to record all the time or during a portion of the day using the scheduled recording method, while also recording upon motion detection. It is a well known fact that a beam of visible or infra red light may be projected from a source to a receiving unit containing a photoelectric cell in conjunction with a suitable vacuum tube, amplifier, detector, and alarm or indicator relay, in such a manner as to constitute a protective system.</p>
<p>Smart home automation features for a more robust security system. Fire-alarm control panels (FACP) or fire-alarm control units (FACU) consist of electric panels that function as the controlling components of a fire-alarm system Figure 9.35).
