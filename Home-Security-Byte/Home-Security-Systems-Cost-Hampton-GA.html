<p>Having a residential fire alarm system at home is extremely important. Video surveillance cameras clue management in on the type of attitude staff members are projecting towards customers. When the lights were dimed and a low light environment was created the image quality of the 2 megapixel IP camera was poor the image quality reduced dramatically. Inability to view video over the internet and low recording quality is serious drawback for analog CCTV to compete with digital systems.</p>
<p>Every alarm system includes window and door sensors that react when the window or door is opened. Such a fire alarm alarm system will require control and indicating equipment (CIE) to control the alarm signal(s) and the fire alarm functions. If you do have a wired system, while not imperative, we would recommend having cell communication with the monitoring company so your system could send a signal to them even if there is a power failure or a burglar cuts the phone line.</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Wireless burglar alarms work similarly to wired ones, but the sensors communicate with the control panel via a radio frequency. Learn more about professional home security monitoring here.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera. The most important consideration in a video surveillance system is the quality of the image received, and this is largely dependent on the camera and recording equipment used. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or desired).</p>

<p>Any potential intruders will see that you have an alarm system in place and are likely to move on to a more vulnerable property than yours. One-stage fire alarm systems warn everyone in the building that a sensor has been activated. Some devices can only be controlled by a remote control whilst others can be controlled in multiple ways: a physical switch on the device itself, a remote control, and a smartphone or any web-enabled device.</p>
<p>In order for a company to provide live monitoring, they must charge a monthly fee, since they will either be connecting your service to the company's central system through a landline phone or through cellular technology.
