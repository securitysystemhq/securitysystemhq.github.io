Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

Surveillance systems can be used to monitor your entryways and windows, and can also be monitored either by you on your smartphone or by a company if desired.

A key aspect of fire protection is to identify a developing fire emergency in a timely manner, and to alert the building's occupants and fire emergency organizations. Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection.</p>
