<p>Just like with any other electronic that you will own, fire alarms and smoke alarms do not last forever.

The modern fire alarm system is capable of detecting smoke and heat from a small flame, water flow in a sprinkler system or an activated pull station, and reporting this information to on-site personnel via dedicated phone line to any location in the world.</p>
