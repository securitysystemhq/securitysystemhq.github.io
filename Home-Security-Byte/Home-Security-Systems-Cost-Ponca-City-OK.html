<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. You will require an Arduino Uno and Raspberry pi 3 model B for this project, for the security purpose you can use a camera for taking pictures, to detect the human interaction in the restricted area you can use PIR sensor, in every industry there are inflammable substances so to detect that you can use MQ6 sensor, you can also monitor some machines like conveyor belt by keeping track of the vibration that they produce and you can also use vibration sensor to check the vibration of the machine for its smooth operation.</p>
<p>Whether you're at the office or away on vacation, our state of the art home security cameras and monitors keep you and your family safe.

<p>If communication with one home monitoring center is interrupted, the other centers takes over quickly, giving them the ability to offer continuous security through the company's advanced alarm monitoring service - providing clients with increased safety and peace of mind.

<p>Detectors might be sited in other areas of the building, but the objective is to protect the escape route. These are the two types of alarm systems. However, some of the security camera systems installed by government security agencies are more complex, and take more time to install. The panel will then activate one or more signaling circuits to sound building alarms and summon emergency help. To further complicate the situation, there are many local security dealers that do not advertise the brand name that will be doing the monitoring.</p>
<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again.
