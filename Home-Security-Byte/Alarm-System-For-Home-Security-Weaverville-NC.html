The newest trend in surveillance technology is the use of wireless cameras. Today's home security systems let you arm and disarm your system without laying a finger on a keypad or control panel.</p>
<p>The cameras deter crime and may lead some students to confess to infractions that weren't even caught on the security cameras.
