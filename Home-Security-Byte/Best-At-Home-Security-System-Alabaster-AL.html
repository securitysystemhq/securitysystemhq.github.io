<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>Every system comes with a free app that allows you to view your cameras anywhere in the world as long as you have internet. Position your cameras strategically around the premises you want to monitor.

<p>That competition has nudged third-party operators to step up their technology to the point where their technology and training can stack up against just about any in-house monitoring service. Manufacturers offer different types of cameras like fixed camera, bullet camera, dome camera, infrared camera, wireless security camera, spy camera and more. This is outdoor security camera does more than the usual surveillance duties - it has people, car and animal detection, allowing it to report in real-time if someone is found loitering around your home, if a car enters your driveway or if your pet is in the yard.</p>

<p>With home security monitoring systems, you can have trained professionals monitor your home 24 hours a day, seven days a week from interconnected command centers.

<p>In this paper, a real-time heart monitoring system is developed considering the cost, ease of application, accuracy, and data security. Cameras with two-way communication have a mic that picks up sound near the camera, plus a speaker that lets you interact with people or pets on the other end. The installation is usually a one time fee, after that you will be paying a monthly fee for monitoring. Installing alarm system also becomes confusing sometimes.</p>
