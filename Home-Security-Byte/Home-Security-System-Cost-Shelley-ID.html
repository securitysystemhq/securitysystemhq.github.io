In a DVR system, cameras have to be hardwired to a DVR device. Dual technology motion detectors can have Anti-cloak technology (ATC) to thwart camouflaged burglars. Not that long ago, the only folks that could afford security cameras were James Bond, NASA and the police.</p>
<p>These can be fitted with timers so that they come on only during the night, and using low-energy bulbs makes them very inexpensive to leave on.
