This service enables ABB to actively participate in ongoing system monitoring and process optimization.</p>
<p>In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm. Most modern home security systems do not require a landline and rely off of cellular and wireless connectivity. Every company on our best home security systems list offers broadband or cellular connections, but not all give you a landline option.
