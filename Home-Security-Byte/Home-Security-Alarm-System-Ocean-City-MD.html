<p>Sometimes also known as CCTV or Closed Circuit Television, video surveillance systems can allow you to track and monitor anything going on inside your home whether you're there or not.

<p>Furthermore, the reduction in the cost of an IP camera has enabled end users to shift from traditional analog systems to IP-based systems for video surveillance.
