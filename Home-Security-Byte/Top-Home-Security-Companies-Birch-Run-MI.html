While it's definitely not the least expensive of the DIY installation home security options, at $399 there's a reason why the starter kit is listed at that price.</p>

One-stage fire alarm systems warn everyone in the building that a sensor has been activated. Some devices can only be controlled by a remote control whilst others can be controlled in multiple ways: a physical switch on the device itself, a remote control, and a smartphone or any web-enabled device.</p>
<p>Our products include, but not limited to, Wide Dynamic Range Cameras, License Plate Recognition Cameras, and High-Definition Cameras, featuring quality imaging chips that are manufactured in Korea. Cameras connect to a network video recorder (NVR) via a PoE (Power over Ethernet) switch, which has ports for many cameras and then uses just one cable to connect to the NVR and power source. Most businesses do not routinely test their fire alarms and of those that do, many do not properly test the systems.</p>
