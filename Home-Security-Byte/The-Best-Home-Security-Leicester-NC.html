But, according to security experts, pound-for-pound, having a monitored home alarm security system, which they strongly emphasize MUST be a good and reliable brand, is perhaps the best and SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION that one could institute in having a home that scares away potential burglars and keeps them away from your home, and your family safety.</p>

An IP kit with cameras, recorders, and accessories that meets the most basic requirements for a small surveillance system.

<p>Because the DVR you choose will be recording the images your security system captures, it's as important a part of the total system as the cameras themselves. CCTV is used for a number of monitoring and surveillance purposes, but is mainly used for security purposes. Forecasting and Post-Event Investigations: The usefulness of surveillance technology in preventing and solving crimes depends on the resources put into it. The most effective systems are those which are monitored by trained staff, have enough cameras to detect crimes in progress, and integrate the technology into all manner of law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>All systems allow you to adjust the sensitivity of the motion detection and it's worth playing with these to avoid getting false alarms when the cat walk past.

You can also connect the dome camera to your PC via the usb cable to view all the recorded videos. In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. While there are some legitimate uses (nanny cams,” employee monitoring, and so on), the low cost and the ease of use means that the capability to perform surveillance by amateurs is a very real and a danger to almost anyone.</p>

The more important wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station.</p>
