<p>Having a home security system isn't just about protecting your home and family, it's about your peace of mind as well. A 7-inch wireless touchscreen panel sits at the heart of the platform, supporting 250 third-party smart home devices like thermostats, lights, and doors as well as ADT's own home security hardware There's support for remote device control from ADT's new mobile app, home automation scenes and geofenced actions, triggering lights and unlocking your front door, for example, as you approach your home.</p>
<p>The control unit, in turn, is linked to an alarm and, in some cases, to an automatic telephone dialer or Internet connection that summons help from a monitoring company. This allows you to set up specific motion detection areas that you want to watch, within your cameras image, and if no one comes in those areas, even though they are in the field of view, it will not be recorded. Besides the video evidence and lower insurance, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras on your own.</p>
