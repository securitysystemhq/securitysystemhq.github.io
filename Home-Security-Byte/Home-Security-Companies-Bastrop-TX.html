A hard-wired system may be limited to the number of peripherals offered by a particular service.</p>
<p>The next item in a home security monitoring system is evaluate is the receivers that contact police, fire, and emergency response. To use remote monitoring effectively, a risk assessment must be performed and included in the monitoring plan prior to the start of any clinical programme and adapted as the programme evolves.
