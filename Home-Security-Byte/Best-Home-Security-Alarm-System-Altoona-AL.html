<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>Also, many of these systems can integrate with other smart-home devices, such as thermostats, locks, and light bulbs. With support for over 2,500 security camera models and related encoders-plus virtualization, centralization, and integration with the most popular access control systems-our video surveillance solutions provide a wide range of benefits to meet your organization's video security demands. Apart from homes and business premises, security cameras have many other applications; they can be used in different places to monitor and prevent criminal activities.</p>

If the building is also provided with an automatic sprinkler system, the water flow devices and valve tamper switches are also connected to the fire alarm system.
