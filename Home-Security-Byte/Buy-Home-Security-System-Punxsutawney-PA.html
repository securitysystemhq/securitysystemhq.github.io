<p>Fire alarms - installed throughout a building - are meant to be a first line of defense in protecting the lives of those within. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. As a rule, flame detectors are used for the protection of challenging premises, such as those involving a risk of hydrocarbon-based fuel or gas fire. Fire detection and extinguishing control panels process results detected by sensors, control alarm devices and set off alarms to permanently manned stations and the fire department.</p>
<p>One of the most popular and cost effective ways of providing security in the home and place of work is with cctv cameras and equipment. Another great feature, in addition to the basic home security equipment, is the array of home automation features that allow you to remotely access, monitor, and control your security system and other equipment in your home. This service enables ABB to actively participate in ongoing system monitoring and process optimization.</p>
