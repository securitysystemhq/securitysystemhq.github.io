It is a pretty straight forward question but makes a world of difference on how your security system is designed. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Remote monitoring and control (M&C) systems are designed to control large or complex facilities such as factories, power plants, network operations centers, airports, and spacecraft, with some degree of automation. That usually means you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel any time - without early termination fees or other hidden charges. Professionally installed systems take the trouble out of things for homeowners who don't have the time or expertise to set up all the sensors and accessories themselves.</p>
<p>You may have to do some systems troubleshooting especially when there are many false alarms.
