<p>Home security cameras have become popular over the last few years. The number of alarm keypads you have installed in your home will depend on its size; in many cases it is simply not practical to have to go to the alarm's main control in order to disengage it. Your home burglar alarm, when triggered, will in all likelihood cause a siren or other loud noise to sound, activate outside lights, and use an auto-dialer to notify the local police department directly of a home intruder, or to notify the alarm company's monitoring system who will then contact your local police.</p>
<p>Drafts can disrupt the operation of smoke detectors and increase the occurrence of nuisance alarms. When a provider allows customers to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring.‚Äù Customers can monitor their homes with the help of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras.

<p>In the case of pan-and-tilt cameras, the camera lens will automatically point itself in the direction of the motion and record.

The STROBE signal is the output from the alarm control panel that will enable the flash lamps from the external sounder.</p>
