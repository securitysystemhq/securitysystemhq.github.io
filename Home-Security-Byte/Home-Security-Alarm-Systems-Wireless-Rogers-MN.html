<p>The best in smart home security systems.

However, it should not be easily seen just by peeping from the window or taking a quick glance at the house. Both of these criteria require a digital camera and also increase your need for storage space and bandwidth. The big bonus is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that doesn't look like a home security system.</p>
<p>The second decision you'll need to make is whether to opt for a wireless alarm system or a traditional wired one. Using the power of the internet, remote monitoring takes on new meaning.
