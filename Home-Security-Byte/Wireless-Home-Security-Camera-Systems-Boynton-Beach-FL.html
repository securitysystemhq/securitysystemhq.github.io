<p>A few decades back, no one had ever heard of a fire alarm for a private home. For example, LifeShield's Security Essentials system will cost you $29.99 per month for three years and includes monitoring, but you'll pay a $99 activation fee and you don't own the equipment at the end of the lease. Some are only good during daylight hours while others are suitable for both day and night recording and are of very good quality, usually they record in colour during the day and black and white at night of course.</p>
<p>Many providers offer smart home devices and or integration features that you can purchase as part of a security system package or as a standalone product.

The British prefer to use "CCTV cameras" when they mention security cameras.</p>
<p>This can help to prevent numerous false alarms that a smoke detector may produce. Analog camera systems are affordable and can be sufficient for remote monitoring depending on the application. TP-Link offers a robust outdoor camera with cloud storage for under $100. The system can also control a wide range of smart home devices that are compatible with Z-Wave, such as smart locks, garage door openers and others , but that doesn't work both ways: You can't control the Xfinity system from Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices or view the camera video outside of the Xfinity Home app.</p>

A fire alarm system can vary dramatically in both price and complexity, from a single panel with a detector and sounder in a small commercial property to an addressable fire alarm system in a multi-occupancy building.</p>

When you place a security company's sticker in a front window and plant their sign in your front yard, you are telling burglars you home is professionally protected and not a wise choice for an attempted burglary.</p>
