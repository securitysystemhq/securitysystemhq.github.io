<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, multi-megapixel IP-CCTV cameras are coming on the market. In contrast, IP cameras encode video that is streamed to the NVR for saving the video stream; the video is not encoded by the NVR. Video walls offer a very big screen so that many people can watch the captured videos from a number of cameras at the same time. This will give you the choice of watching the videos from these cameras live or at another time.</p>
