<p>The way a fire alarm is designed means the difference between life and death. Conventional fire alarms are the most basic type of fire detection system. Bruce Johnson, Regional Manager for Fire Service Activities with the International Code Council says, Fire alarm systems and smoke alarms are life safety systems that save countless lives each year, both civilians and firefighters. Fire alarms alert building occupants of a fire and alarms that alert emergency public responders (police and fire) through a central station link to initiate an appropriate response.</p>
<p>Disadvantage: high rate of false alarm or no alarms at all for systems using light that leaks out of the optical fiber. When a sensor or alarm is tripped on a DIY system , you'll receive a notification on your phone. For indoor locations as shown in Table 1 , a camera that provides a very wide angle of view is needed so as reduce the requirement of the no of cameras and to reduce the dark spots. A category L2 system designed for the protection of life and which has automatic detectors installed in escape routes, rooms adjoining escape routes and high hazard rooms.</p>
<p>The sensors are typically placed in doors that lead to and from a house as well as easily accessible windows, particularly any that open, especially those at ground level. Smoke information classification solves the problem of low accuracy of traditional smoke alarms. Some dummy cameras do have added features such as a cable that can be fitted into a conduit to make it look even more real and I do think this is a good idea.</p>
