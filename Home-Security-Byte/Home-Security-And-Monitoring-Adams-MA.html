Analog security systems - the recorded images or footage is sent to the DVR recorder (Digital Video Recorder) using a coaxial cable.

<p>Most have motion detection settings that only record footage when the camera detects movement. However, with the proper placement of the wireless sensors in your home, your wireless home security alarm system will be just as secure - if not more - than a hardwired system.

This could come in different types and one good example is a CCTV security system which is obtained though placing of video cameras in strategic locations in and around your home.</p>
